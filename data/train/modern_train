I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again
But if Antony is alive healthy friendly with Caesar and not Caesars prisoner Ill shower you with gold and pearls
Madam hes well
Thats well spoken
And hes friendly with Caesar
You are an honest man
Caesar and he are better friends than ever
Im going to make you a rich man
But yet madam I dont like the sound of but yet It reverses all the good that came before it
Damn those words but yet But yet is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal
Please my friend give me all the news both good and bad at the same time
You say hes friendly with Caesar healthy and free
I didnt say free madam
No I didnt say that
Hes bound to Octavia
For what favor
For the favor of sleeping in her bed
Im sick Charmian
Hes married to Octavia madam
May you die of the worst disease
Good madam be patient
What did you say to me
Get out you horrible bastard or Ill gouge out your eyes
Ill scalp you
Ill have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle making your pain linger
If you say it isnt true Ill give you a province and make you rich
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me
Hes married madam
Rogue youve lived too long
No way then Ill run
Whats the matter with you madam
I havent done anything to you
Good madam restrain yourself
The man hasnt done anything wrong
Even innocents cannot always escape disaster
May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes
Call that servant back
Even though Im mad I wont bite him
Call him
Hes afraid to come in
I wont hurt him
My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress
Come here sir
It may be honest but its never wise to bring bad news
You can give good news in many ways but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it
Ive only done my duty
Is he married
May the gods destroy you
Do you maintain the same story
Do you want me to lie madam
Go get out
Even if you were as handsome as  I beg your highness pardon
Is he really married
Please dont be offended that I dont want to offend you any more
Its not fair to punish me for something you make me do
Hes married to Octavia
Its too bad that Antonys fault should make you look like a jerk
Go away
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me
Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you
Be patient your highness
When I have praised Antony Ive disparaged Caesar
Many times madam
Im being repaid for that now
Help me out of here
Oh Iras Charmian
It doesnt matter
How old is she
Dont let him leave out the color of her hair
Bring me his answers quickly
Even though half of him is like a 
Lord Alexas sweet Alexas most anything Alexas almost the most consummate Alexas wheres the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen
Oh I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife
I dont make fortunes I only see them
Then see a good one for me
No he means youll use makeup when youre old
May my wrinkles forbid that
Dont joke about his predictions
Pay attention
Quiet
You will love more than you are loved
Its proper that we speak first which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar
Take your time
Pompey you cannot frighten us with your navy
Well meet you at sea
Yes on land you do outnumber me
Even more since you annexed my fathers house and lands
But since  To get back to the matter at hand what do you think of our proposal
Thats the point
Dont let us talk you into anything but consider carefully the value of our offers
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia
In return I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome
If I agree to this we may leave unharmed with our shields undented
Thats our offer
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer
Let me shake your hand
I didnt think I would see you here
The East is very seductive
Well I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage 
Its good we had this meeting
I hope it works out for the best Lepidus
So we are in agreement
Thats the next thing on the agenda
Well have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways
Ill give the first one Pompey
No Antony
Whether your banquet is first or last your Egyptian cooking will make it the best
I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there
Youve heard a lot
I mean well sir
Im sure you do
Ive heard a lot more
I heard that Apollodorus carried   What did he carry please
How are you soldier
Im well and probably will be for a while as I hear that four feasts are being prepared 
Let me shake your hand
Ive never been your enemy
Ive seen you fight and envied your skill
Sir I wouldnt say I was your friend but Ive praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave
Enjoy your frankness it suits you
I invite you all aboard my ship
After you my lords
Show us the way sir
Come with me
I think it was at sea
That it was sir
Youve done well at sea
And youve done well on land
Ill flatter anyone who flatters methough what Ive accomplished on land cannot be denied
Neither can my accomplishments at sea
Yes for your own safety you should deny one thing you have been a great thief at sea
As you were on land
Thats the one part of my service on land I do deny
But lets shake hands Menas
If our eyes were policemen they might capture two thieves at once while were embracing
Mens faces are truthful whatever their hands do
But no beautiful woman has an honest face
Thats no lie
They steal hearts
We came here to fight against you
For my part Im sorry this battle turned into a drinking match
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune
If thats true he wont get it back by crying
Thats the truth sir
We didnt expect Mark Antony to be here
Is he married to Cleopatra
Caesars sister is named Octavia
Thats true sir
She was previously Caius Marcellus wife
But she is now Mark Antonys wife
Excuse me sir
Its true
Then Caesar and he will always be united
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union I wouldnt say that
I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love
I think so too
But youll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them
Octavia has a pious chaste meek disposition
Doesnt everyone want a wife like that
Not someone who doesnt share that disposition meaning Mark Antony
Hell go back to his Egyptian dish
Then Octavias complaints will rouse Caesar and as I said before the thing that brought them together will part them
Antony will go where his passion is
He only married out of political necessity
Then thats the way it may turn out
Come on sir will you come aboard
I want to drink your health
Ill join you sir
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt
Lets go
Heres where theyll end up on the floor
Some of them are leaning already
Lepidus is red in the face
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor
Id rather carry a reed that obviously cant protect me than a sword I cannot lift
This is how they do it sir they measure the depth of the Nile according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty
The higher the Nile flows the better the harvest
The harvest comes shortly after that
Do you have unusual snakes there
Yes Lepidus
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud just like the crocodile
I dont feel so well but I wont stop
Not until you pass out
Im afraid youll keep going until then
Ive heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid
Without doubt Ive heard that
What does a crocodile look like
Sir its shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width
It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs
Its own color
Its a strange snake
It is that
And its tears are wet
What is it
Ive always had great respect for your destiny
Youve served me faithfully
What else can I say
What are you saying
Would you like to be king of the entire world
Now Ive said it twice
How could that happen
Just listen to him
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune
Tell me that Ill marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them
Oh excellent
Then my children will probably be illegitimate
Tell me please how many boys and girls will I have
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one you would have a million children
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish
Well all want our fortune told
My fortunelike that of many of us tonightis to go drunk to bed  
Are you drunk
No Pompey I havent had anything to drink
Tell me how
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat
Everything that belongs to them is yours
Oh you should have done it without telling me
For you to do it would be good service
You should know that to me profit isnt more important than honor but the other way around
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions
But now I must condemn it
Give it up and go drink  
This toast is for Lepidus
Heres to you Menas
I accept with thanks Enobarbus
There goes a strong fellow Menas
Why do you say that
He carries a third of the world
Cant you see that
Then a third of the world is drunk
Drink up
All right then
This hasnt reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet
Its getting there
Clink your cups together in a toast
Heres to Caesar
I could do without another toast
Live in the moment
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one
Lets have one good soldier
Come lets join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful
Everyone join hands
How can you top that
Good night Pompey 
Yes we will
Lets shake on it
Were friends
Come this way to the rowboat
Be careful not to fall in
Menas Im not going back on shore
No come to my cabin
What do you say
Theres my hat
Hooray
Come on noble captain
Now Ive paid you back Parthia and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus death
You must understand Silius that its better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superiors absence
Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captains rival
I could do more to help Antony but to do so would insult him
A soldier is just a tool like his sword unless he has your qualities Ventidius
Are you going to write Antony about this
Ill write how under his flag and with his wellpaid troops we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia
Wheres Antony now
Did the brothersinlaw leave
They finished their business with Pompey and Pompey has left
Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome
Caesar is in a sober mood
Hes a stylish man
And how he loves Caesar
Yes but how he adores Mark Antony
Caesar
Then whats Antony
A god of a god
Are you talking about Caesar
Hes without equal
Oh Antony
Oh you  If you want to praise Caesar just say his namethats all the praise thats necessary
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments
He loves Caesar best but he also loves Antony
Oh
Hearts cannot think it tongues cannot speak it measurements cannot calculate it scribes cannot write it bards cannot sing it and poets cannot make verses about it
He loves them both
They are his dung and he their beetle
So theres the signal to ride
Goodbye noble Agrippa
Good luck worthy soldier and goodbye
You cant go any further with us sir
If you and I dont value her equally it would be better for us to work out our differences without her
Dont insult me with your distrust
I mean what I say
You wont find any cause for anxiety even if you look for one
So may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support
Well leave you here 
Goodbye my dearest sister goodbye
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease
Farewell
My noble brother
Her eyes are like April full of showers
What is it Octavia
Ill tell you privately
See now I have you
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods
Goodbye
Be happy
Farewell farewell
Farewell
Like the  Oh stop it you lusty bedhopper
You cant see the future
Well if a moist palm isnt a clear sign of promiscuity then I cant scratch my own ear
Your fortunes are the same
But how
Give me details
Ive said what I have to say
Isnt my fortune just a little better than hers
Well if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me where would you like the improvement
Not in my husbands nose
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts
Alexas
If its sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife its a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife whos faithful
Therefore dear Isis do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves
Where is that messenger
Hes afraid to come in
Oh come onCome here sir
Gracious Queen even Herod of Judea wouldnt dare look at you unless you were in a good mood
Ill have Herods head chopped off
Most formidable Queen
Did you see Octavia
Yes revered Queen
Where
In Rome Madam
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony
Is she as tall as I am
She is not madam
Did you hear her speak
Is her voice pitched high or low
Madam I heard her speak
She has a lowpitched voice
Thats not in her favor
He cant like her very long
Like her
Oh Isis thats impossible
Youre right Charmian
She creeps along
She has a body not a life
Is this true
If not then I have no powers of observation
There arent three people in all of Egypt who could do better
She doesnt have anything going for her so far
This messenger is wise
Very wise
Do you hear that Charmian
And I think shes at least thirty
Do you remember her face
Was it long or round
Round enough to be unattractive
Usually that means a person is foolish
What color is her hair
Brown madam and she wouldnt want her forehead to be any lower
You mustnt hold my earlier outburst against me
Ill hire you again to go back to Rome
My letters are ready to go
Hes an admirable man
He certainly is
Im very sorry I was so hard on him
Not a bit madam
Everything may still be all right
I assure you it is madam
Oh dear husband dont believe everything you hearor if you must believe it dont let it all make you angry
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree
Gentle Octavia support the one that supports you
In the meantime Ill raise an army that will surpass his
May the god of power make me the weakest of the weak your mediator
When you find out who started this disagreement turn your anger upon them
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions
How goes it friend Eros
Some startling news has just arrived sir
What news man
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey
Thats old news
Whos winning
So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them theyll battle each other to the death to have it all
Wheres Antony
Another thing Domitius Antony wants to see you now
I should have waited to tell you my news
But never mind
Take me to Antony
Come with me sir
In Alexandria he condemned Rome and thats not all
This is what happened he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silvercovered stage in the marketplace
He did this in public
He gave Syria Cilicia and Phoenicia to Ptolemy
Lets send this news to Rome
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already
The people have heard it already and theyve been told of his accusations
Who does he accuse
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius possessions which we seized in Sicily
Then he says I didnt return some ships he loaned me
Sir these accusations should be answered
It has been done already and the messenger is on his way
I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position
Hell never agree to that
Then we wont agree to his demands
Greetings Caesar my lord
Greetings dearest Caesar
Oh to think youve been rejected
Youve never thought of me like that and you have no reason to
Then why did you travel so quietly
You didnt arrive like Caesars sister
Antonys wife should have an army to escort her with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears
The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven
I would have met you by sea and again by land
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him
Which he quickly allowed given that youre an obstacle to his lust
Amen
Quiet
Here comes Antony
Have you seen my lord
No lady
Wasnt he here
No madam
He was in a good mood and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome
Madam
Here at your service
Here comes my lord
Your wife Fulvia mustered her army first
Against my brother Lucius
Yes
Dont say that my lord
Where do you think he is now
Hes in Athens my lord
No hes not
Cleopatra summoned him
Hes given his empire to a whore and now theyre gathering kings to wage a war
Hes recruited Bocchus the King of Libya Archelaus of Cappadocia Philadelphos King of Paphlagonia the Thracian king Adallas King Manchus of Arabia the King of Pont Herod of Judea Mithridates King of Comagen Polemon and Amyntas the kings of Mede and Lycaonia and many more
Im divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other
Youre welcome here
I didnt write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations
Cheer yourself
You will always be welcome to me 
Welcome lady
Welcome dear madam
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us
Its undeniable
You are welcome here sister
I beg you to continue to be patient
My dearest sister
But why why why
You opposed my taking part in the war
Isnt this war against me
Why shouldnt I be there in person
What do you mean
Let Rome fall
May the tongues of our critics rot
I have responsibilities in this war and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man
Dont argue against it
I wont stay behind
No Ive had my say
Here comes the Emperor
Isnt it strange Canidius that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take ToryneHave you heard about this sweet
No one admires speed more than the lazy
What else
Why do you want to do that my lord
Because hes daring us to do it
So youve dared him to single combat
Yes and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia where he fought against Pompey
But Caesar ignores offers that dont give him an advantage and so should you
His ships are maneuverable
Yours are slow and awkward
Refusing to fight him at sea wont disgrace you
Ill fight at sea
Even if we fail at that we can still fight him on land
Whats your business
The news is true my lord
He has captured Toryne
Canidius take our nineteen 
Whats the news brave soldier
Oh dont fight by sea noble Emperor
Dont trust rotten planks
Dont you trust my sword and these wounds
Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe
Well well lets go
By Hercules I think Im right
Soldier you are
Our leader is being led
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together dont you
Marcus Octavius Marcus Justeius Publicola and Caelius will go by sea but well keep the bulk on land
Caesars speed defies belief
While he was still in Rome he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled
Whos his lieutenant do you know
A man named Taurus they say
I know the man well
The Emperor is calling for Canidius
The present time is like a woman in labor each minute giving birth to some piece of news
Taurus
My lord
Dont attack by land
Dont provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea
Our fate depends on this chance
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill in sight of Caesars navy
I cant watch any more
The Egyptian flagship the  Gods and goddessesthe whole congregation of them
Whats wrong with you
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness
We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces
How goes the battle
Right in the middle of the fight just when the battle could have gone either wayactually we had a slight advantagethat immoral Egyptian nagMay she die of leprosysuddenly became frightened and turned her ships around and fled
I saw that
The sight made me so sick I couldnt watch any more 
Well give me the worst news
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward
Go on
As far as Im concerned whats past is done
Its like this as long as a person tells me the truth even though it means my death I will listen as though he praised me
Oh my lord
Speak plainly
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her
Its easy to err when left to our own devices but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them
Goodbye for a while
I never saw such a shameful act
Terrible
Terrible
The battle on the sea is almost lost
If our general had been his old self we would have won
Oh with his sordid desertion he sets the example for our own
Are you considering desertion as well
Then everything must really be finished
They fled toward Peloponnesus
Ill yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar
Listen
Friends come here
Im completely lost
I have a ship full of treasure
Escape and make peace with Caesar
Flee
Not us
Ive told cowards to turn their backs on me and run
Friends go
Ive decided on a plan that doesnt require your assistance
Leave
Oh I followed something Im ashamed to look at now
Even my hair revolts
Friends go
Ill give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you
Please dont be sad and dont tell me how reluctant you are
Take your cues from my own despair
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself
Go to the harbor immediately
Ill give you the title to that ship and its treasure
Just give me a moment pleaseonly a moment
Ive relinquished my authority so pleaseIll see you all before long
What else
Let me sit down
Oh damn damn damn
Madam
Madam oh good Empress
The Queen is here my lord
Go to him madam speak to him
Hes not himself because he feels so ashamed
Well then help me
Most noble sir stand up
The Queen is coming
Shes weak and will die unless you comfort her
Ive destroyed my reputation a most shameful error
Sir heres the Queen
Oh where have you led me Egypt
Oh my lord my lord forgive my panic
I didnt think you would follow me
Queen you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you
You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods orders in favor of yours
Oh forgive me
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man
You knew that my sword weakened by my love for you would obey that love no matter what 
Dont shed even one tear
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost
Give me a kiss
This repays me
Let the envoy from Antony come in
Do you know him
Come forward and speak
Humble as I am I represent Antony
Until recently I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean
So be it
Say what youre here for
If that is not granted he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens
Thats all he asks for himself
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority
As for Antony Im not interested in his requests
Ill give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him
Then Ill listen to her
Give my answer to them both
May good luck follow you
Take him safely through the lines
I go Caesar
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions
I will Caesar
What are we going to do Enobarbus
Think about our situation then die
Who is to blame for this Antony or I
Only Antony was at fault
Why should he have followed you
With half the world opposing the other half it wasnt the time for Antony the pivotal player to let love distract him
To race after your departing ships leaving his navy to watch was a shame as great as the resulting loss
Please lets not talk about it
Is that his answer
Yes my lord
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up
Thats what he says
Tell her 
Your head my lord
A messenger has arrived from Caesar
With no more ceremony than that
See ladies how they scorn me now
Ill be at your service
Hes waiting outside
Whats your message
Your wife Fulvia is dead
Where did she die
In Sicyon
In this letter youll find details of her illness and other more serious matters that concern you
Leave me  
What does Caesar want
It is for your ears only
There are only friends here
Speak confidently
So they are possibly Antonys friends
Sir he should have as many as Caesar has
If Caesar chose Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend
As for us you know we are Antonys and he is Caesars
Just remember that he is Caesar
He knows that you didnt embrace Antony because you loved him but because you feared him
Oh
He is like a god and knows the truth
My honor wasnt given it was only dominated
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection
Whats your name
My name is Thidias
Most kind messenger tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him
Promising favors
By Jove that thunders
Who are you slave
You will be whipped  
Take away this lout and whip him
By the moon and stars
Whip him
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her handwhats her name now
Whip him fellows until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy
Take him away
Caesars knave will bring him a message for us
My good lord Youve always been a liar
But when our vices become habitsOh the sadness of itthe wise gods blind us shade our better judgment make us love our mistakes and laugh as we strut to our ruin 
Oh has it come to this
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesars plate when I met you
No you were one of Gneius Pompeys leftoversnot to mention your other more depraved affairs which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip
For Im sure that although you may know what temperance is youve never experienced it firsthand
Why are you doing this
Soundly my lord
Did he cry
Did he beg my pardon
He did ask for mercy
Are you done yet
You my earthly moon are now eclipsed and that alone foretells my ruin
In order to flatter Caesar would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants
Dont you know me still
Has your heart cooled toward me
Ah dear if that is true let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart and let the first hailstone drop down my throat
As it dissolves so shall my life
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion until one by one all my children and every one of my brave Egyptians are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied covered by gnats and flies
I am satisfied
I will fight him there
Our land forces have bravely stood firm
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail as formidable as the sea itself
Where have you been my bravery
Do you hear what I say lady
If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips Ill be covered in blood
My sword and I will earn our place in history
We still have hope 
Thats my brave lord
Ill fight brutally
But now Ill grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me
Come lets have one more extravagant night
Invite all my sad captains
Lets drink through midnight
Its my birthday
I had planned to celebrate it quietly but since my lord is once more himself I will be Cleopatra again
Well win yet
Do so
Ill speak to them and then tonight Ill get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds
Now hell work himself up to a fury
When courage consumes reason it destroys its only weapon
Ill look for some way to leave his service
He calls me boy and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt
Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die and in the meantime well laugh at his challenge
Dont give him time to catch his breath
Anger does not protect the angry well
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrows battle to be the last we fight
Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antonys former soldiersenough to capture him
See that it is done and prepare a feast for the soldiers
We have enough supplies for it and theyve earned it
Poor Antony
What would you like sir
I have to leave right away
That will kill our lovers
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them
If we leave it will feel like nothing less than death to them
I must be gone
If its that important then let the women die
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing but if its a matter of choosing between them and a great cause then theyre worthless
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this shell die immediately
Ive seen her claim to be dying twenty times before and for far less reason
I think there must be something invigorating about death since she dies with such enthusiasm
Shes more cunning than anyone can imagine
Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods
He wont fight with me Domitius
No
Why wont he
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours it would be like pitting twenty men against one
Tomorrow soldier Ill fight by sea and land
By the end I will either live or else Ill restore my honor by shedding my blood
Will you fight well
When I strike Ill cry All or nothing Well put
Come on
Call out my household servants
Tonight lets have plenty to eat
You have all served me well and kings are your peers     
The gods forbid
Well my good fellows wait on me tonight
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants obeying my commands
Looktheyre crying
Ha ha ha
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that
Those tears will bring blessings to you
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense my hearty friends
You should know my friends that I have good hopes for tomorrow and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death
Good night brother
Tomorrow is the day
Have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city
No
What was it
It was probably just a rumor
Good night
Well sir good night
Soldiers watch carefully
You too
This is our station
And if our navy wins tomorrow no doubt our army will do their part
Its an outstanding army and highly motivated
Quiet
Whats that sound
Listen
Theres music coming out of thin air
From under the earth
Its a lucky sign isnt it
No
Quiet I say
What does this mean
Hello there good sirs
Yes
Isnt it strange
Do you hear that men
Do you
Lets follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops
Good idea
Its very strange
Get a little sleep
Come on good fellow help me into that armor youre carrying
If luck deserts us today its because we defy it
Come on
No Ill help too
Whats this part for
Ah leave it alone
You armor my heart
No
No
Really Ill help
It must go like this
Weve got it nowDo you see this my good fellow
Go and put on your own armor
In a minute sir
Didnt I buckle this well
Excellently excellently
HurryOh love if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft
Good morning to you
Welcome
You look like a person who knows the business of war
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully
Even though its early there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor
The weather is fair
Good morning General
Good morning General
That was a fine fanfare boys
Like a young man who wants to amount to something this morning begins early
Farewell lady
Whatever happens to me this is a soldiers kiss
Ill leave you without revealing any emotion like a man of steel 
Lead the way
He goes forth to war bravely
May the gods bless Antony today
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land
If you had the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you
Who deserted this morning
You dont know
Someone who was always near you
Sir hes with Caesar
Sir he left his belongings and treasure
Hes gone
Its certain
Eros send his treasure to him
Do it now
Dont keep anything back I insist
Write to him from meIll sign itsending greetings and gentle goodbyes
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master
Oh my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors
Hurry
Fulvia is dead
Pardon me
Fulvia is dead
Fulvia
Dead
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth there would be a reason to grieve
But in this way grief and comfort appear together
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started
The business you began here needs you as wellespecially the business with Cleopatra which only you can attend to
Enough of this frivolous talk
Give our officers notice of our intentions
Ill tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave
Fulvias death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return
The empire may be in danger if hes not restrained before he reaches his full potential
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become fullfledged threats  
Agrippa go start the battle
We want Antony taken alive
Make sure everyone knows that
I will Caesar
An era of universal peace is about to start
That way Antony will feel like hes fighting his own men
Caesar hanged him for this service
Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust
Ive done a bad thing for which I will blame myself so much that Ill never be happy again
Enobarbus Antony has sent you all your treasure with generous gifts besides
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent
Its yours
Dont joke about this Enobarbus
Im telling you the truth
Youd better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return
Id do it myself but I cant leave my post
Your Emperor is still a king among gods
I am the worst person alive and I know it the best
Oh Antony you extravagantly generous man how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold
My heart feels like its about to explode
If grief doesnt kill me Ill find a quicker way to kill myselfeven though I think grief will do the job just as well
I fight against you Antony
No Ill go find some ditch to die in
The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life
Retreat
Weve advanced too far
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected
Oh my brave Emperor this is what I call a fight
If wed fought like this before wed have driven them home with bandaged heads
Youre bleeding a lot
I had a scar here that looked like a T now its an H Theyre retreating
Well chase em into their latrines
I still have room for six more wounds
Theyre retreating sir and our superiority indicates a clear victory
Lets slash their backs and grab em like we do rabbits from behind
Its fair game to mark a coward
Ill reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage
Come on 
Ill limp after you
Weve driven him all the way back to his camp
One of you run to the Queen with the news
Before sunrise tomorrow well kill anyone who escaped today
You are all    Lord of lords
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world 
My songbird we have beaten them to their beds
What do you think girl
Look at this man
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind
He deserves it even if it were covered with jewels like holy 
If we arent relieved in an hour we have to return to our barracks
Oh listen to me night Who is this
Stay hidden and listen
Be my witness oh you blessed moon
Thats Enobarbus
Quiet
Keep listening
My heart which dried out with grief will surely break apart into a powder and that will be the end of my disgusting mind
Oh Antony
Lets speak to him
Lets listen to him
Good idea
But hes sleeping
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep
Lets go to him
Wake up sir wake up
Speak to us
Do you hear us sir
The hand of death has taken him
Lets carry him to the barracks
Hes an important person
Our hour is up
Come on then
He may recover yet
I will
Theyve switched their operation to the sea today
We didnt please them on land
Were ready for both my lord
I wish theyd fight in fire or in the air
But heres the plan our army will stay with us on the hills by the city
Lets take up the best positions we can in the valleys
They still havent joined the battle
Ill be able to see better from that pine tree over there
Ill let you know right away how its going
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatras sails
All is lost
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me
Threetime traitor and whore
Tell the army to flee
Order them to escape
Go
Oh sun I will never see another one of your sunrises
Luck and Antony separate here and now
Here well shake hands goodbye
Is it all come to this
Ive been stripped of everything betrayed
Oh that devious Egyptian spirit
Ah you sorceress
Be gone
Why is my lord enraged against his love
Get out of my sight or Ill give you what you deserve and spoil Caesars victory
Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds
Follow his chariot like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender
Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails
Shell die for itEros ho
Help me ladies
Go to your tomb
Lock yourself in and send him word that youre dead
When a great person departs it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body
Say the last word I spoke was Antony and please word it pathetically
Go Mardian and let me know how he reacts to my death 
Eros can you still see me
Yes noble lord
Youve seen these illusions
Yes my lord
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water
Thats true my lord
Eros my young friend your captain is now just like that cloud
Here and now I seem like Antony but I cant keep myself in this form my boy
No dont cry kind Eros
Oh your contemptible lady
She has disarmed me
Get out insolent eunuch
Silence
She has betrayed me and shall die
A person can only pay with their life once and she has paid in full
What you wanted is yours
Most noble Antony Then as she was speaking your name a strangled groan split her words
Antony was divided between her heart and lips
She gave up her life with your name still within her
Is she dead then
Dead
Remove your armor Eros
Off
Take off my armor
Oh chest obey me
Heart for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined
Faster Eros faster
I wont be a soldier anymore
Battered armor be off
You were worn with honor 
I will catch up with you Cleopatra and weep for your forgiveness
Since the light of my life has gone out Ill stop here
Now any effort ruins what it attempts
Yes even power gets in its own way
End it then and everything is overErosIm coming my QueenErosWait for me
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers well walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor
Eros
What can I do for my lord
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace
Do it
This is that time
You wont be striking me down but defeating Caesar
Call up your courage
The gods forbid
Can I do what all the Parthian arrows though shot by enemies could not
Eros would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesars victory parade his arms crossed and tied his head bowed in submission his face red from shame while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him putting the final stamp to his humiliation
I would not
Draw your trustworthy sword which you have used in such service to your country
Oh sir pardon me
When I freed you from slavery didnt you swear to do this when I asked you
Do it immediately or all your previous services to me were accidental without purpose
Take out your sword and come on
Then turn your noble face away from me that face that the whole world adores
Look
Where is he
I havent seen him recently
What should I do that Im not doing
Always give him his way
Never contradict him
Dont push him too far
I wish youd be patient
We come to hate that which controls us
But here comes Antony
I am sick and sullen
Im sorry to have to say this Help me away from here dear Charmian
I shall faint
I have drawn my sword
My dear master my captain my sovereign let me say before I strike this fatal blow farewell
Youve said it friend and farewell to you
Goodbye great commander
Should I do it now
Now Eros
Well then there
With this I avoid the grief of Antonys death
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books
I learned to do this from you 
What
Im not dead
Oh kill me
Whats the trouble
Ive botched the job friends
Oh finish what Ive begun
Our guiding light is out
And time itself is ended
Sadness and despair
Whoevers a real friend should strike me dead
Not me
Me neither
None of us
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor
Wheres Antony
There Diomedes there
Is he still alive
Why dont you answer me man
Is that you Diomedes
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me
Most powerful lord my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you
When did she send you
Just now my lord
Where is she
Locked in her tomb
She had a premonition of what has actually happened
Afraid that your anger would not subside she sent you word she was dead
Too late good Diomedes
Call my guard please
Hey out there
Carry me good friends to where Cleopatra is
Its the last command I shall ever give you
Were very sorry sir that you may not live to wear us out with your commands
Its a very sad day
No my friends dont please fate by giving it your sorrow as well
If we welcome our punishment we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly
Pick me up
I have often led you now you must carry me my good friendsand take my thanks for everything
Oh Charmian I will never leave this tomb
Be calm dear lady
No I wont
Strange and terrible events are all welcome but I despise comforts
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source
Whats the news
Is he dead
He is close to death but not dead yet
Oh Antony Antony Antony
Help Charmian help Iras help
Be calm
It was not Caesars bravery that conquered Antony but Antonys that has triumphed over himself
Thats the way it should beonly Antony should conquer Antony
No our generals infatuation is out of control
His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops
His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights but now hes lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore
Look at them
Take a good look and youll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whores jester
Look and see
If what you feel is really love tell me how much
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated
I want to measure the extent of your love to see how far it stretches
Then you would have to go beyond heaven beyond earth
I have news from Rome my good lord
I am dying Cleopatra dying
I just beg death to wait awhile until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips
I dont dare come downforgive me my lordI dont dare for fear of capture
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesars prize
If knives poison or snakes have edge effect or venom I am safe from that fate
Your wife Octavia with her selfeffacing eyes and selfrighteous assumptions wont get any praise from patronizing me
Help us good friends
Oh quick before Im gone
Such exercise
My lord is so heavy
If I had the goddess Junos power I would make the strongwinged messenger Mercury pick you up and seat you beside Jove
And welcome welcome
Die where you have lived in my arms
If my lips had the power to give life I would wear them out like this
What a sad sight
I am dying Cleopatra dying
Give me some wine and let me say a few words
Ill trust my determination and my hands but none of Caesars men
Now I feel my soul leaving
I cant speak any more 
Most noble man will you die
Dont you care about me
Shall I stay in this dreary world which is no better than a pigsty without you
My lord
Oh the glory of war has faded
The flags have fallen
Young boys and girls are equal to men
There is nothing distinctive nothing remarkable left in the world
Our Queen is dead too
Lady
Madam
Oh madam madam madam
Royal Egypt Empress
Quiet quiet Iras
Now I am no more than a woman ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores
Now all is for nothing
How are you my ladies
Cheer up
How are you Charmian
My gallant girls
Good noble ladies be brave
Well bury him and then well commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans and make death proud to take us
Come on you can go
The container of that great soul is now cold
Ah ladies ladies
Lets go
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death
Tell him to surrender
His position is hopeless
Right away Caesar
What are you doing with a sword
Who do you think you are coming in here armed
My name is Decretus
I served Mark Antony who was the commander most worthy of my services
While he was alive I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies
If not you can kill me
What are you saying
Caesar Im telling you that Antony is dead
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap
The fractured world in its confusion should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions dens
This isnt the death of one man
Its the death of half the world 
Now my dearest Queen Please stand farther away from me
Whats the matter
I can see in your eyes theres been some good news
What does your wife say you can come home
I wish shed never let you come
Dont let her say I kept you
I have no power over you
You belong to her
The gods know Oh never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been
I knew from the first it would be this way
Cleopatra How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselvesyou who were unfaithful to Fulvia
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart
When you begged to stay that was the time for words
You didnt want to go then
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows
My features are still that beautifulor else you the greatest soldier in the world have become the greatest liar by overpraising them
This is his sword
I pulled it from his wound
Lookhis noble blood is still on it
Listen sad friends though the gods may rebuke me this news would make kings cry
His faults were equally matched by his virtues
But gods you give us faults so well be human
Caesar is upset
Either I had to ruin you or you would have ruined me
Let me tell you friends
Ill tell you at a better time
This man looks like his business is urgent
Lets hear what he has to say
Tell her to put her mind at rest
Shell find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her
May the gods bless you
Come here Proculeius
Tell her we mean her no disrespect
Go and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind 
I will Caesar
Gallus you go with him
Wheres Dolabella
Dolabella
I remember hes already occupied
Hell be done in time
Come and see the proof
Its pathetic to be Caesar
He cant be Fortune hes only Fortunes errand boy
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him
Whats your name
My name is Proculeius
But I dont worry about being deceived because I dont need to trust
If your master wants a queen to beg from him you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom
If he will grant me conquered Egypt so that I may give it to my son I will kneel to him with thanks
Be content
Youre in the charge of an honorable man
Dont be afraid
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly hell request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune
Im learning every hour how to be subservient
Ill tell him all of this dear lady
Be at ease
Your majesty
Oh Cleopatra
Stop brave lady stop
We have not betrayed you
What am I being denied death as well
Dont insult my masters generosity by killing yourself
Your death would prevent that
Where are you Death
Come here
Come and you can have a queen
Oh control yourself lady
Let Caesar do whatever he wants
Youd better understand that I wont wait till Im chained up in your masters court and I wont let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia
Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome
Id rather die in a ditch in Egypt and make it my gentle grave
Id rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me making me disgusting
Id rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids
Youll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so
Proculeius Caesar has heard about what youve done here and has sent for you
Ill take the Queen into my custody
So be it Dolabella
Be kind to her
Have you heard of me most noble Empress
I dont remember
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams
Isnt that your habit
I dont know what you mean madam
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony
Oh I wish I could sleep again so I could have another dream like that
When he raised his arm in command the world trembled
There was no end to his generosity
Kings and noblemen served him
Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change
Cleopatra Do you think there ever was or could there ever be a man such as the one I dreamed about
No gentle madam
The gods can hear you lying
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings
Listen to me madam
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable
I hope I never achieve success if I dont feel some of your heartbroken grief right now
Thank you sir
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me
Im reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew
You need not kneel to me
Please rise Queen
The gods have ordained it to be like this sir
Dont think I blame you
Ill leave you now
You may do whatever you want in the world
Its yours and you may hang us your trophies of war anywhere you like
Here my good lord
What do you mean lady
I wish I were as big and strong as you
Listen to me Queen
There is an emergency I must take care of but my whole heart will remain here with you
My Italy is full of civil war
Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome
But my personal motivationand that which should move you most to sanction my departureis that Fulvia is dead
Is it possible Fulvia is dead
Shes dead my Queen
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra
This is the inventory of the money silverware dishes and jewels that are still in my possession
Not even trivial things were left out
Wheres Seleucus
Here madam
This is my treasurer
My lord he will swear on his life that I havent kept a thingTell the truth Seleucus
Madam Id rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it
What did I keep for myself
Enough to buy everything you have declared
No dont be ashamed Cleopatra
Look around you Caesar
Oh just see what happens after the pageantry is over
Seleucus ingratitude makes me wild
Ill give you a good reason to cringe I promise you
Ill scratch out your eyes even if they could fly
Oh that was unbelievably low
Cleopatra our conquest wont include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed
Its all still yours
Do whatever you like with it
So cheer up
No dear Queen
Eat and sleep
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend
And so goodbye
My master and my lord
Not true
Goodbye
But listen Charmian
Its time to end it good lady
I will madam
Wheres the Queen
Look sir
Dolabella
Make the best use of this information you can
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise
Dolabella I will always be in debt to you
And I your servant
Goodbye good Queen
I must go attend Caesar
Farewell and thanks
Now Iras what do you think
You will be exhibited in Rome along with me like Egyptian puppets
Crude slaves with greasy aprons rulers and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see
The gods forbid
No its certain Iras
Insolent  Oh the good gods
No thats the truth
Ill never see it
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes Ill scratch them out
Why thats just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions
Now Charmian
Women dress me like a queen
Go get my best clothes
Whats that noise
Theres a farmer here who wont leave without seeing your Highness
He has brought you figs
Let him come in
What a poor instrument that can do such a noble deed
He brings me freedom
Theres nothing of the weak woman left in me
Now from head to foot Im as firm as marble
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me
This is the man
Leave us
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain
I certainly do have him but I wouldnt advise you to touch him
People who die of it seldom or never recover
Do you remember anyone who died of it
Many people men and women alike
Indeed she gives a very good testimony of the snakes power
But if you believe everything they say you wont be saved by half of what they do
But this is a sure thing the snakes an odd snake
I hope you are pleased with the snake
Farewell
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature
Yes yes
Farewell
There isnt any kindness in the snake
Good
Will it eat me
Dont think Im so dumb that I dont know that the devil himself wont eat a woman
Well you can go now
Farewell
Give me my robe
Put on my crown
I long to be immortal
Quickly quickly good Iras quickly
I think I hear Antony call me
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act
I hear him mock Caesars luck which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath
Now let my courage prove my title as wife
So are you done
Come then kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips
Goodbye kind Charmian
Iras I wont see you again for a long time
Do I have the asps poison on my lips
Did you fall
If you can leave your body so easily then the touch of death is like a lovers pinch which hurts but is desired
Do you lie still
If you leave like that you tell the world that its not worthy of a goodbye 
Clouds dissolve into rain so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth
Poor poisonous fool be angry and bite
Oh if you could speak I might hear you call Caesar an ass whos been outsmarted
Oh eastern star
Quiet quiet
Dont you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep
The poison is as sweet as balm as soft as air as gentleOh AntonyNo Ill take you too
Why should I stay In this vile world
So goodbye
Now Death you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession
Close soft eyes
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again
Your crown is crooked
Ill straighten it then play Wheres the Queen
Speak softly
Dont wake her
Caesar has sent Too slow a messenger
Oh come quickly
I almost feel you
Theres Dolabella who was sent from Caesar
Call him
What kind of work is this Charmian
Is this well done
It is well done and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings
Ah soldier
Whats going on in here
Theyre all dead
Caesar you thought this would happen
Youre coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop
Oh unfaithful lover
Stop arguing and listen to my plans
Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you
I swear by the sun that when I leave here it will be as your faithful servant
Cut my corset laces Charmian so I can breathe
Hurry
Just as Antony loves
Control yourself my precious Queen and concede that my love is true
Thats what Fulvia told me
I beg you turn away and cry for her
Then say goodbye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit
Oh sir you are too good at predicting the future
What you were afraid of has happened
How did they die
I dont see any blood
Who was with them last
A simple country farmer who brought her figs
This was the basket
They were poisoned then
Oh Caesar this Charmian lived until a moment ago
She stood and spoke
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress
She stood trembling then suddenly dropped dead
Oh noble weakness
Here on her breast theres a little bloody mark
Theres a similar mark on her arm 
This is an asps trail and these fig leaves have slime on them just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb
She shall be buried next to her Antony
No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome
Come Dolabella
Youll make me angry
No more of this
I know you can do better than that but itll do for now
I swear by my sword Swear by your shield too
Ill leave you lady
Polite sir let me say one thing
Sir you and I must part companyno thats not it
Its difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart but bear with me
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you dont approve of them
Your honor is the reason you are leaving
May the gods be with you
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed 
Lets go
Come with me
Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here you come with me and even though I leave here I stay with you
Youre too forgiving
Even if we said that this behavior suits himthough only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such anticstheres no excuse for the extra work weve had to take on while hes been off amusing himself
If hes been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits then hell be punished with venereal diseases and thats his business
Heres more news
Pompey has a strong navy
I should have known it
Its been this way ever since the first government was organized
Caesar I have news about Menecrates and Menas notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships
Theyve made many raids upon Italyand the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them
Antony its time to stop your wild hedonism
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand
You drank horses urine and water from scumcovered puddles that even animals would refuse
Its too bad
Lets hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly
Its time that we brought our armies into the field
Pompey is making the most of our absence 
Tomorrow Caesar Ill be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war
Ill be getting my own figures together in the meantime
Goodbye
Goodbye my lord
Charmian
Madam
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone
You think about him too much
Thats treason
I hope not Madam
What can I do for your highness
I dont want to hear you sing
Im not interested in anything a eunuch can do
Its a good thing for you that being castrated you can better concentrate on my needs
Do you have desires
Yes dear madam
Indeed
Well not in deed madam since I cant do anything unchaste
Is he standing or sitting
Or is he walking
Or is he on his horse
Oh how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him
Hes speaking now or perhaps hes whispering Wheres my serpent of the Nile For thats his pet name for me
Im killing myself with this provocative speculation
Are you thinking about me
No listen to it Antony
Perhaps  What my love
Maybe
No most likely
You cant stay here any longer
Call in the messengers and well find out
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt Antony youre blushing which means youre Caesars servant
Call the messengers  
Queen of Egypt greetings
You are nothing like Mark Antony
But since you come from him youre saturated with his healing spirit
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony
The last thing he did before sending me off dear Queen was to kissthe last of many such kissesthis Indian pearl for you
My ear must pull it out
Good friend he said say that the faithful Roman sends an oysters treasure to the great Queen of Egypt and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire
Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply
Was he sad or happy
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold he was neither sad nor happy
Just notice
He wasnt sad because he knows that his disposition affects others
He was somewhere in the middle between them
Oh heavenly mixture
Whether you are sad or merry the intensity of either suits you like no one else
Yes madam twenty different messengers
Why did you send so many
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar
Bring ink and paper Charmian
Welcome my good Alexas
Charmian did I ever love Caesar as much as this
Oh that splendid Caesar
May you choke on any other sentiments like that
Say That splendid Antony The courageous Caesar
By Isis Ill give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony my best man among men 
Pardon me but Im just repeating what you yourself have said
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didnt know what passion was
In that case the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good
Ill do well
The people are on my side and Im in charge of the sea
My forces are growing and everything I know tells me its all coming together
Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and wont be going outside to make war
Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money
Lepidus flatters both of them as they flatter him but he doesnt love them and they dont love him
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation
They have a massive army
Where did you hear this
Its not true
From Silvius sir
Hes dreaming
I know theyre in Rome together hoping for Antony to return
Lecherous Cleopatra may all the charms of love soften those withered lips
Join your witchcraft with your beauty and let Antonys lust combine with both
Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery
This news is absolutely true Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now
In the time since he left Egypt he could have traveled an even longer distance
His military ability is double that of the other two
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antonys attention away from that Egyptian widow 
I dont expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion
Menas I dont understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones
It will be as the gods see fit
In any case our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible
Lets go Menas
Good Enobarbus you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly
I will advise him to speak as he usually does
By Jupiter if I were Antony I wouldnt shave my beard today
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances
But major issues must come before minor ones
Not if the minor ones come up first
Here comes the noble Antony
And there comes Caesar    
Youre right
If we were in front of our armies about to fight I would do this
Welcome to Rome
Thank you
Have a seat
After you
No after you
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easilyand laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully when I had no reason to speak of you at all 
Caesar what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt
But if you conspired against my position while you were there I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt
How do you mean conspired
You can judge for yourself what I mean
Your wife and brother led troops against me claiming to be fighting in your name
They said they were acting for you
Youre mistaken
My brother didnt use my name to justify his rebellion
He rejected my authority as much as yours
Ive already sent the proof in my letters
If you want to pick a fight youll have to find a more substantial excuse
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment but youre just making up feeble excuses 
Not true not true
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause
As for my wife if only you had such a wife
Its easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that
But you cant blame me for her offenses
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria
I was not myself as a result of the wine
The next day I explained all this to him which was as good as begging his pardon
Lets not fight over this fellow
Meet with the ambassadors
Tonight well wander through the streets and observe the people
You will never be able to say the same about me
Go on Caesar
What part of the agreement did I break
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them
You refused me both
I overlooked your request but I did not deny it
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions
Spoken like a gentleman
If its okay with you you should not press your grievances any further but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you
Well put Maecenas
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished
You can argue as much as you like when theres nothing else to do
You are only a soldier
Dont speak any further
As you please
May I speak Caesar
What is it Agrippa
You have a beautiful halfsister Octavia
Great Mark Antony is a widower now
Youd better not make that suggestion Agrippa
If Cleopatra heard you you would be well punished for your audacity
Its true Im not married Caesar
Let me hear what Agrippa has to say
With this marriage all the petty jealousies that now seem huge and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves would disappear
Since she would love both of you you two would be joined in that love
What do you say Caesar
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia
I wouldnt dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea
Heres my hand
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister
She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts
Im happy to say amen to that
I didnt think I would ever fight Pompey
There isnt much time
Either we go after Pompey or hell come after us 
Where is he now
Near  How large is his land army
Large and increasing
But his navy rules the sea
Thats what I hear
Come with us Lepidus
Noble Antony even illness couldnt keep me away
Good Enobarbus
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably
And I see you survived your time in Egypt
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfastfor only twelve people
Is that true
That was nothing
There were many even more memorable feasts
Shes a remarkable lady if the rumors are to be believed
Ill tell you
The sails were dyed purple and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love
The oars were made of silver and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music
Pretty Cupidlike boys stood on either side of her smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them undoing what they did
How excellent for Antony
When she landed at the port Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead
Royal seductress
Now Antony has to leave her completely
Age wont wither her and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring
Even her worst faults are charming and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut
Lets go
Good Enobarbus consider yourself my guest as long as youre here
I humbly thank you
And I will spend our time apart on my knees praying for you
Good night
Tell me why if you can
But you had better get back to Egypt again
Tell me who shall have the better luck Caesar or me
Caesar
So youd better not stay with him Antony
Your guardian angel is noble courageous significant and unmatched when Caesars not around
But when you are with him your angel is weakened and easily frightened
Thats why there must be space between you 
Have a good night
Dont speak of this again
To none but you only to you
With his natural luck he will beat you even against the odds
Your light dulls when he is near
Leave now
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him
Come here Ventidius
You must go to Parthia
Your authorization is ready
Come with me and Ill get it for you
Dont spend any more time here
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations
Sir well follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia goodbye
Goodbye then until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear which will suit you both very well
Youre taking a shorter route
My plans take me a roundabout way
Youll get there two days before me
Good luck sir
Farewell
Play me some music
Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers
Musicians come in
Never mind
Lets play billiards
Play with me Charmian
My arm is sore
Ill do my best madam
I dont want to play now
Give me my fishing rod
Well go to the river
With my music playing in the background Ill lure fish
Cram your good news into my ears
Madam madam Antonys dead
If you say that you bastard youll kill your Queen
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand
Let me say first madam that he is well
Well then heres more money for you
But you know sirrah we customarily say that the dead are well
If thats what you mean Ill melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words
Good madam let me speak
All right I will
But you dont look as if you bring good news
If you really are Sir Rowlands son as youve just whispered to meand I can absolutely see the likeness in your face you are truly welcome here
I am the duke who loved your father
Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your storyGood old man you are as welcome here as your master is
Give him your arm
Give me your hand and explain your situation to me
You havent seen him since
Sir sir that cant be true
If I werent a merciful man Id forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place
But do this find your brother wherever he is
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year or get out off my land
Im seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter I have never in my life loved my brother
That makes you an even bigger villainWell throw him out and have my officers seize his house and lands
Do this immediately and send him packing
Hang there on this tree you lines of poetry and bear witness to my love
And you  And how are you liking the shepherds life Master Touchstone
Well in and of itself it is a good life but given that its a shepherds life its worthless
In the fact that its solitary I enjoy it very much but in the sense that its private its terrible
Now Im very pleased with it being outdoors but in its not being at the court it is boring
Are you any kind of philosopher yourself shepherd
Youre a naturalborn philosopher
Were you ever at court shepherd
Honestly no
Then you are damned
I hope not
Explain
Well if you were never at court you were never exposed to good manners if you never witnessed good manners your manners must be wicked wickedness is a sin and committing sins leads to damnation
You are in a perilous state shepherd
Not at all Touchstone
The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court
You told me that you dont salute at the court but kiss hands
Now if courtiers were shepherds that kind of courtesy would be unclean
Give a quick example
Come explain
Why because were always handling our ewes and their fleece as you know is greasy
What dont courtiers hands sweat
And isnt a sheeps grease as wholesome as a mans sweat
Thats a poor example
A better examplecome on
Besides our hands are hard and calloused
Then your lips will feel them more quickly
Come on
You worthless man
You are about as much of a thinker as worms meat is a nice steak
Learn from the wise and comprehend the courtiers perfume is made from cat dischargemuch more disgusting than tar
Fix your example shepherd
Your wit is too courtly for me
Ill rest now
Good morning sir
Can you tell me whether Rosalind Duke Seniors daughter has also been banished
Where will the old duke live
Youre going to rest while youre still damned
God help you foolish man
Pray God does some surgery on you you need to be fixed
Thats another sin arising from your ignorance you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation
Here comes young Mr Ganymede my new mistresss brother
There is no jewel like Rosalind
Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world carrying the name of Rosalind
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind
Dont think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row excepting meal times and sleeping hours
That awful plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market
Oh stop fool
Let me try If theres a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do
A cat in heat will look for a mate And Rosalind certainly will too
Winter garments need to be filled with something And so does skinny Rosalind
After you harvest you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart
The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut
The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it and by Rosalind
This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along
Why bother with them
Quiet you stupid fool
I found them on a tree
Well the tree bears rotten fruit
All right youve had your say but well let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely
Quiet
But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence  Ill write Rosalinda Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman
Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain
Nature took Helens  Cleopatras majesty The best of Atalanta And unhappy Lucretias modesty
So by heavens decree Rosalind Was composed Of different faces eyes and hearts so that she might have the most prized touches of all
Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave
Were you listening to these verses
Oh yes I heard them all and more too
Some of those lines had more feet than the  Thats not a problem the feet can bear Sure but these feet were 
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees
Was it a man
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck
Are you blushing
Please who
Its difficult to bring two friends together but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes
No who are you talking about
Is it possible
No Im begging you now tell me who it is
Oh this is wonderful wonderfuljust wonderful wonderful
Good grief do you think that just because Im dressed like a man I have a mans patience
Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas
Im begging you tell me who it is quickly and speak fast
I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrownecked bottle either too much at once or none at all
Im begging you take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news
So you want to put a man in your belly
Did God make him
I mean what sort of man is he
Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard 
No he has only a little beard
Well eventually God will send him some more hair if he thanks Him
Ill wait till his beard grows in if youll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on
Its Orlando who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant
Damn you for mocking me
Really cousin its him
Orlando
Orlando
What did he do when you saw him
What did he say
How did he look
Where did he go
What brings him here
Did he ask about me
Where is he staying
How did he say goodbye
And when will you see him again
Answer me in a word
Youd better get me  But does he know that Im here in the forest and dressed in mens clothing
Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling
But taste my story and relish it by paying attention
I found Orlando under a tree like a dropped acorn
That tree could be called Gods tree since it drops such wonderful fruit
Let me talk good lady
Go on
He lay there stretched out like a wounded knight
Though that must have been a pitiful sight the ground looked beautiful
Cry whoa to your tongue please
Its leaping about like a frisky horse
He was dressed like a hunter
Oh thats ominous
He has come to kill my heart
Id like to sing my song solo
Youre making me go offkey
Dont you know that Im a woman
Whatever I think I have to say
Sweetheart go on
Quiet
Isnt that him heading this way
Thats him
Thanks for your company but really I would have preferred being alone
Me too but still for the sake of good manners Ill say thanks for your company
Goodbye
Lets meet as little as we can
I also hope that we can be better strangers
Please dont ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks
Please dont ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly
Your loves name is Rosalind
Yes thats it
I dont like her name
How tall is she
Just as tall as my heart
Youre sure full of smooth answers
Your worst fault is being in love
Well its a fault I wouldnt trade for your best virtue
Im tired of you
There Ill see only myself
Which is either a fool or a nothing
Im not going to waste any more time with you
Goodbye good Mr Love
Im glad to see you go
Adieu good Mr Depression
Very well
What do you want
You should ask me what time of day it is instead
Theres no clock here in the forest
Then there must be no lovers in the forest either because theyre as good as a clock marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour
Indeed I do sir and Ive come to let you in on a certain problem
Ive been informed by certain sources I cant disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise
Tomorrow sir Im fighting for my reputation and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed
Your brother is young and inexperienced and because of my affection for you Id hate to crush himthough Id have to if he challenged me
Im telling you all this out of affection for you so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace which will be his own fault not mine
Charles I thank you for your loyalty to me and youll see that Ill reward you
Id heard about my brothers plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind but hes determined
I tell you Charles hes the stubbornest young fellow in France overly ambitious jealous of other peoples good qualities and a traitor against me his own blood brother
So use your discretion
Id be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger
But if I really laid him bare Id have to weep and hang my head and you would not believe me his behavior is so shocking
Why didnt you say the swift steps of time instead of the lazy foot
Wouldnt that have been just as appropriate
No not at all sir
Time travels at different speeds for different people
I can tell you who time strolls for who it trots for who it gallops for and who it stops cold for
Okay who does it trot for
Who does time amble for
Time ambles for both men
Who does it gallop for
Who does it stand still for
For lawyers on vacation because they sleep their holidays away with no sense of how time moves
Where do you live pretty young man
Were you born here
Just like the rabbit who lives where she is born
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this
Many people have told me so
Actually an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak and he was brought up in the city
Thank God Im not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of
There were no primary ones
Please tell me some of them
No I wont give my medicine away to anyone but the sick
Theres a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving Rosalind on their barks
Well Im the man youre speaking of
Please tell me your cure
But you dont have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about
He taught me how to recognize a man in love and youre not a prisoner of love Im sure
What did he say the symptoms were
A thin face which you dont have a sleepless sunken eye which you dont have an irritable temper which you dont have a neglected beard which you dont havebut that might not be so telling since you dont have much beard anyway
Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles your hat flying off your head your sleeves unbuttoned your shoes untied and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery
But youre no such man
Youre so neat and well puttogether that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else
Young boy I wish I could make you believe that Im in love
Make me believe it
But really are you the one whos been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind
I swear to you by Rosalinds own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man
Are you really as in love as your poems declare
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her
The only reason they dont get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it too
But I promise it can be cured with some guidance
Have you ever cured anyone this way before
Yes one and this is how I did it
I dont want to be cured boy
I could cure you if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me
By my faith in love I will then
Tell me where you live
Come with me Ill show you and along the way you can tell me where you live
Will you come
Wholeheartedly good young man
No you have to call me RosalindSister youre coming
Come on sweet Audrey
Ill get your goats Audrey
Do my simple features please you
Your features God help us
What features
Really Audrey I wish you were more poetical
I dont know what poetical means
Is it chaste in word and action
Does it mean being truthful
Not really for the truest poetry is often the most artificial
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical
I do in fact
Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin if you were a poet I might have some hope you were lying
What you dont want me to be chaste
Not really unless you were ugly
Well Im not beautiful so I hope that I can at least be chaste
Im not a slutI keep myself cleanbut I thank God I am ugly
Well praise the Lord youre ugly
Well God bless this marriage
Amen
Well thats what the wife brings to the marriage
Horns
Well there they are
Only for poor men
No no
The noblemans are as huge as the underfed villagers
Is the single man lucky then
No
Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a lowlying village a married mans horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelors bare forehead
Here comes Sir Oliver
Will you marry us here under this tree or should we follow you to your chapel
Is there anyone to give the bride away
I dont want to take another mans secondhand goods
No someone has to give her away or the marriage isnt legal
How are you sir
Were glad to see you
God bless you for being here
Im very glad to see you
This is just a trifling matter here sir
No no put your hat back on
Do you want to get married fool
Just as the ox has his yoke the horse its bridle the falcon a tether a man has his desiresto keep in check
And being a man of your breeding youre going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar
Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest who can tell you what marriage is all about marry you
Then one of you will warp and pull awayand there goes your marriage
Come with me and let me advise you
Come sweet Audrey
We have to be married properly
None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession
Dont talk to me
Im going to cry
Go ahead if you want but remember that crying doesnt suit a man
But dont I have good reason to cry
As good a reason as any
So go ahead and cry
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest
Im very glad I came to see you
If he shows up tomorrow Ill give him whats coming to him
If he can manage to walk after our fight Ill never wrestle for money again
Farewell my lord
But not for long Charles will take care of everything
But you heard him swear up and down that he was
Hes staying in the forest with your father now
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him
He laughed at that and let me go
He writes brave poems speaks brave words makes brave promises and then breaks them just as bravely
Hes like a cowardly 
Whos coming here
Mistress and master youve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with
Yes what about him
Sweet Phoebe do not scorn me
Do not Phoebe
Go ahead and say you dont love me but not so bitterly
Faint fall downif you dont then youre lying about my eyes being murderers
Come on show me the wound that my eyes have caused
But my eyes which Ive darted at you havent even left a mark
Now I am sure that eyes cant hurt a person
Oh darling Phoebe if you ever fall in love with some fresh face then youll know about the invisible wounds that loves sharp arrows can make
Well until that time dont come near me
And when that time comes then you can mock me but please dont pity me because I wont pity you  
But mistress know yourself
Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man
Ask this mans forgiveness love him and accept his offer
So take her shepherd and God bless you
Besides I dont like you
Come on sister
And dont be proud
The whole world could look at you and no one would be as blind as he is thinking youre beautiful
Sweet Phoebe have pity on me
Well Im sorry for you gentle Silvius
Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured
You have my friendship
Isnt that enough
I want you
Well thats just greedy
But dont expect any more than that
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me
Not very well but Ive met him several times
Dont think Im in love with him just because Im asking about him
But what do I care about words
And yet words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to
Hes awfully proud but his pride suits him
Hell grow up to be a proper man
Hes not very tall but hes tall enough for his age
His legs arent great but theyre alright
His lips were nice and red a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeksone was pure red and the other more pink
What right did he have to scold me like that
He said my eyes and my hair were black and now that I think of it he scorned me
Im surprised I didnt bite back
But no matterIll get back at him soon enough
Ill write him a taunting letter and you can deliver it
Will you do that for me Silvius
With all my heart Phoebe
Ill be bitter toward him and curt
Come with me Silvius
Please pretty young man Id like to get to know you better
They say you are a melancholy fellow
I am
I like it better than laughing
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful
Well I think its good to be serious and keep quiet
In that case its good to be a post
I dont have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer
Youre a traveler
Well then you have good reason to be sad
Im afraid youve sold your own land to see other mens
To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands
Not true
And your experience makes you sad
Id rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sadand to travel for all that trouble no less
Good day and happiness to you darling Rosalind
My beautiful Rosalind Im only an hour late
Please Rosalind my sweet cousinbe happy
Dear CeliaI already look much happier than I feel but you want me to look even happier
Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father you shouldnt try to teach me how to be happy
Well by this I can see that you dont love me as much as I love you
If  Well Ill just forget the difficulties of my situation in order to focus on the happiness of yours
I swear I will and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster
So please my sweet Rose my dear Rose be happy
From now on I will cousin and Ill think of all kinds of games for us
Let me seewhat do you think about falling in love
Youd break a date with your beloved by a whole hour
Forgive me darling Rosalind
No if youre ever late like this again Ill refuse to see you
Id rather be wooed by a snail
A snail
Besides he brings his fate with him
What fate is that
Why his cuckolds horns of coursethe kind you men are always blaming on your wives
See the snail already has its horns which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wifes infidelity
A virtuous woman wont give her husband horns and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous
And I am your Rosalind  
Come on woo me woo me
Im in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want
What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind
Id kiss you before I spoke
No it would be better to speak first and kiss only after youve run out of things to say
When good orators finish talking they spit when lovers do God help us if they ever do they kiss
What if she wont kiss me
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves
Indeed you would be out if I were your mistressif my chastity is worth as much as my wit
Arent I your Rosalind
I like to pretend you are because then its almost like actually talking to her
No you wont die yourself but only by proxy
This world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love
Then love me Rosalind
Okay I willon Fridays and Saturdays and the rest
And will you have me
Sure and twenty others just like you
Whats that
Well arent you a good man
I hope so
And can a person ever have too much of a good thingCome on sister you can be the priest and marry usGive me your hand OrlandoWhat do you say sister
Please marry us
I do
Okay but when
Right now as fast as she can say the vows
Then you have to say I take you Rosalind to be my lawfully wedded wife I take you Rosalind to be my lawfully wedded wife
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me but Ill take you Orlando to be my husband
So do all thoughts
They have wings
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her
Forever and a day
No Orlando men are like April when theyre wooing a girlyoung and passionatebut like December once theyre married and their passions have cooled
Ill be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain more fond of new things than an ape more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey
Ill cry at nothing and Ill always do it when youre in a good mood
And when you want to go to sleep Ill be up laughing like a hyena
But will my Rosalind do this too
But she is wise
Right
The wiser the woman the wilder
If you close the doors on a womans wit itll fly out the window
If you shut the windows it will pour out the keyhole
If you stop up the keyhole it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke
A man with a wife like that might ask Hey wandering wit where are you off to Nah better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbors bed
Youll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue
A woman who doesnt know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husbands fault is hardly a woman
Rosalind I have to leave you for two hours
I must join the duke for lunch
Ill be back here with you by two oclock
Oh go leave me
I knew youd turn out this way
My friends told me as much and I knew it too
So take me death
Youll be back at two oclock
Yes sweet Rosalind
So beware of my contempt and keep your promise
Ill keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind
So goodbye
Well time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal
Goodbye
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours
We should rip off your mans clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly
Oh cousin cousin cousin my sweet little cousin I wish you knew how deep in love I am
Or its bottomless at least pour affection in one end and it runs out the other
Cupidthat blind bastard son of Venus conceived from a thought and anger born from insanity that blind naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he cant see himselflet Cupid judge how deep my love runs
Im telling you Aliena I cant stand being apart from Orlando
Im going to find some shade and sigh until he returns
And Im going to sleep
Which one of you killed the deer
Yes sir
Then sing it
It doesnt matter if its in tune so long as its loud enough                      
What do you say now
Isnt it past two oclock
And I see a lot of Orlando here
Look whos coming
No I swear I dont even know whats in it
Phoebe wrote it
Well then what should we do for fun instead
Lets go find that hussy Fortune and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally
Oh really
Well when Nature makes a person beautiful cant Fortune make her fall into a fire thereby making her ugly after all
And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument hasnt Fortune sent this fool here to stop us
Come on youre a fool and driven to extreme measures by love
The point is that she didnt write this letter
These are a mans words and his handwriting
Im telling you its hers
Why she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian
No a womans gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings
Do you want to hear what she says
If you want to read it as I havent heard it yet though Ive heard too much of Phoebes cruelty
Shes Phoebeing me
Listen to what the tyrant says
You call that ranting  
You call this sneering
Why do you pity him
Follow them straight to the cottage
Since you asked I suppose its not bragging to say that we are
Orlando sends his regards to you both and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls his Rosalind Is that you
It is
Its about who I am and how why and where this handkerchief was stained
Please tell us
He looked to the side and pay attention to what he saw then under an oak treewhose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittlehe saw a wretched beggar with overgrown hair and beard asleep on his back
He discovered that the man was his older brother
Oh Ive heard him talk about that brother and he described him as the most inhumane man alive
He turned away twice and almost left him there
But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved
Are you his brother
Was it you that he rescued
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him
That was me but its not me Im not ashamed to tell you what I once was since Im so happy to have since converted
But what about the bloody handkerchief
Ill get there
After a brief timeas he is a strong brave man
Many people faint when they see blood
Theres more to it than thatGanymede
Look hes recovering
I want to go home
Well take you there
Please will you take his arm
Buck up boy
Youre a man
You dont have a mans courage
Its true I confess
Oh sir someone would think I was a good fake
Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on
Whoohoo
That was no show
Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint
Fake Im telling you
Well then be brave and pretend to be a man
Thats what Im doing
But honestly I should have been a woman
Come on you keep getting paler
Ill do that because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him Rosalind
Ill think of something
But please tell him how well I faked a faint
Will you come with us
Well get married at some point Audrey
Be patient
Really the priest was good enough no matter what that old guy said
No he was wicked and vile
But Audrey theres a boy in the forest who claims youre his girl
Here comes the man himself
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin
How old are you friend
Twentyfive sir
A mature age
Is your name William
Yes its William sir
A good name
Were you born here in the forest
Yes sir thank God
Thank Godthats a good answer
Are you rich
Well soso
Soso is good very good an excellent answer
And then again its not so good but only soso
Are you wise
Yes sir Im fairly witty
Well thats a fine answer
Give me your hand
Are you educated
No sir
Then learn this from me if you have something you have it
Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass the cup becomes empty
Why the he that will marry this woman
Or rather Ill kill you or Ill do away with you or Ill turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity
Ill poison you or beat you with a club or stab you with a sword
Ill bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness
I will in other words kill you in three hundred and fifty ways
Therefore tremble with fear and leave
Do what he says William
Farewell sir
Our master and mistress are looking for you
Lets go
Hurry up Audrey hurryIm coming Im coming
Mistress you have to go see your father
Did they make you the messenger
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good and that the mustard on top of themhe swore on his honorwas bad
Now Ill swear to the oppositethat the pancakes were rotten and the mustard was finebut even so the knight wasnt lying
And how out of your great heap of knowledge will you manage to prove that
Yes please unleash your wisdom
Watch me stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave
By our beards if we had them you are a knave
And I swear by my wickedness if I had any that I am a knave
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her
It will be to your advantage because Ill leave our fathers house and all his property to you while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest
You have my consent
You can be married tomorrow if you want
Ill invite the duke and all of his followers
Go get Aliena readybecause look here comes my Rosalind
And hello to you fair sister
Oh darling Orlando its so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling
Actually its my arm
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lions claws
Theyre in the heat of passion they simply have to be together
You couldnt beat the two of them apart
Theyll be married tomorrow and Ill invite the duke to the ceremony
But oh it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another mans eyes
Tomorrow Ill be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved in having what he wished for
Well then cant I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow
I cant live by pretending anymore
I wont exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat
You should know that I think youre a smart man
Believe me then that I have special powers
Since I was three years old Ive been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magicianno black magic here
If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena
I know where she is and if you dont mind I will set her before you tomorrow whole and unharmed
Are you serious
I swear on my life which I take pretty seriously even if I am a magician
Look here comes someone who loves me along with someone who loves her
I dont care
A faithful shepherd worships you
Silvius tell this youth what it means to be in love
It means being full of sighs and tears like I am for Phoebe
And like I am for Ganymede
And like I am for Rosalind
And like I am for no woman
It means being faithful and ready to serve just like I am for Phoebe
And like I am for Ganymede
And like I am for Rosalind
And like I am for no woman
It means being filled with fantasy with passion and wishes with adoration loyalty and devotion
And I for Rosalind
And I for no woman
Since you know all this is true why do you blame me for loving you
And why do you blame me for loving you
And why do you blame me for loving you
Who are you talking to
Im saying it to the girl who isnt here and doesnt hear me
All right stop this
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon
As long as Im alive Ill be here
Me too
Me too
Tomorrow is the happy day Audrey
Well be married tomorrow
I hope it doesnt make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman
Here come two of Duke Seniors pages
Good afternoon good gentleman
It really is good to see you
Come sit sit and sing me a song
Sounds good to us
Sit between us
Should we just get down to it
Yes yes and lets sing in unison like two gypsies riding on a single horse                
Really young men though it wasnt a very hard song to get right the music was still all out of tune
Orlando do you really believe that this boy can do everything hes promised
Yes even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her
I will even if I were king of all kingdoms
Yes even if I die an hour later
But if you decide not to marry me youll marry this faithful shepherd instead
Thats the deal
Even if marrying her meant I died
Ive promised to make everything right
Phoebe keep your promise to marry me and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me
Silvius keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me
Ill leave now to set all these things right
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter
My lord when I first saw him I thought he was your daughters brother
But my lord this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic
My lord welcome this man
This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest
He swears he used to be a courtier
If anyone doubts this let him put me on trial
I have bankrupted three tailors
I have quarreled four times and almost got in a fight
And how was that one settled
Well we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause
What do you mean the seventh cause
I like him very well
Tell me who is this knight
A man old Frederick your father loves
If he has my fathers love then thats enough honor for me
Enough of this
No more talk about my father youll be whipped for slander one of these days
Its a pity that fools arent allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do
Honestly youre speaking the truthever since the fools were  With his mouth full of news
Which hell shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young
Then well be stuffed with news
Well thats good
If were  Hello Monsieur Le Beau
Whats the news
Fair princess youve missed some good sport
Sport
Of what 
God bless you sir
This poor virgin isnt much to look at sir but shes mine
Really hes very witty and full of wise sayings
But back to that argument you mentioned
Whats the seventh cause
I didnt like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard
He sent me word that whether I liked it or not he liked it fine
They call this the argumentative countercheck And so on through the circumstantial lie and the direct lie And how many times did you say his beard wasnt cut well
Hes as smart as they come but just a jester
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite
Good duke come receive your daughter
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes brought her here
If my eyes dont deceive me you are my daughter
If my eyes dont deceive me you are my Rosalind
If my eyes arent deceiving me goodbye love
Quiet
My niece you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter
Let me have your attention for a moment
Im Sir Rowlands middle son and I bring you news
When Duke Frederick heard that great worthy men were coming to this forest every day he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother
I swear on my life that Im speaking the truth
Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk
Yes he has
I will go find him
There is much to be learned from these converts 
Stay Jaques stay here for a bit
No this fun is not for me
Ill wait for you in your cave where you can tell me what you need from me
Lets proceed
Well begin the ceremony the way we hope it will endwith delight
If its true that you dont need 
What color madam
I dont understandhow should I answer that
However your wit and luck allow
Tell us about this wrestling
Well weve missed the beginning its dead and buried
There comes an old man with his three sons It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale
Three proper young men all good looking and with great presence
Right and they wore proclamations around their necks saying Be it known to all men by these  The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles the dukes wrestler
Charles did the same to the second brother and the third
Theyre lying over there and the poor old man their father weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving
Oh dear
But tell me monsieurwhat sport are the ladies missing
Why the one I just told you about
Me too I swear
Doesnt anyone else want to see this and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs
Shall we go watch this wrestling cousin
Yes I see them coming
Lets stay and watch
Come on
Since the youth wont be reasoned with hell have to suffer for his stubbornness
Is that the man
Thats him madam
Alas he is too young
Yet he seems capable
Whats up daughter and niece
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling
Yes my lord if you give us permission
You wont enjoy it much I can tell you the odds are so against this young man
Because hes so young Ive tried to discourage him but he wont listen
Call him over here good Monsieur Le Beau
I remember Adam thats  Here comes my master your brother
Go hide Adam and youll hear how he abuses me
Mister Challenger the princess wants to speak to you
Ill wait on them with all respect and duty
Young man have you challenged Charles the Wrestler
No lovely princess
He is the general challenger
I have only come inlike the others haveto try to fight him with the strength of my youth
Young gentleman you are too bold for your age
You have seen the cruel proof of this mans strength
If you took a good look at yourself or if you thought about this more carefully your fear would teach you to act more cautiously
We beg you for your own sake to respect your safety and give up
Please young sir
If Im killed it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead
I wont wrong any of my friends because I dont have any to mourn for me and I wont have wronged the world because I dont have anything in the world
In this world Im only taking up space
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have
Mine too to join hers
Good luck
I hope to God Im wrong about your chances
I hope you get what you desire
You get only one round
No Im sure your Grace wont be able to persuade him to try a second round even though you couldnt dissuade him from trying the first
You should mock me    I wish I were invisible so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg
Oh what an excellent young man
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes I can tell you whod be on the ground
No more no more
How are you doing Charles
He cant speak my lord
Carry him away
What is your name young man
Orlando my lord the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys
I wish you were someone elses son
The whole world thought your father was an honorable man but he was always my enemy
I wish you had told me you had a different father
If I were my father cousin would I do this
Im proud to be Sir Rowlands sonhis youngest sonand I would never change that not even to be Fredericks adopted heir
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul and the rest of the world shared my fathers opinion
If I had known this young man was his son I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight
Gentle cousin lets go thank him and encourage him
Yes
Good luck fair gentleman
Hes calling us back
My  Will you come on cousin
Im coming
Farewell
What is this passion that ties up my tongue
I cant speak to her even though she asked me to
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you
Good sir as a friend I advise you to leave this place
Although you deserve praise applause and love right now the duke misconstrues everything youve done
The duke is temperamental
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her fathers sake
Goodbye sir
Later in a better world than this Id love to get to know you
Im indebted to you
Goodbye
Out of the frying pan and into the firefrom a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother
But oh heavenly Rosalind
Whats going on Rosalind
I dont even have one to throw at a dog
No your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs
Throw some of your words at me
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any
Is all of this about your father
No some of it is about my childs father
If we walk on the wellworn paths they wont get caught in our petticoats
Cough them up
Id try it if I could cry hem and have him
Come on take control of your feelings
But theyre siding with a better wrestler than myself
Oh thats a good wish
Youll fight with him eventually and  The duke my father loved his father very much
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son
By that kind of logic I should hate Orlando since my father hates his father
But I dont hate Orlando
No please dont hate himfor my sake
Why shouldnt I
Doesnt he deserve it
Let me love him because he deserves it and you can love him because I do
Look here comes the duke
He looks angry
Madam hurry as fast as you can get out of my court
Me uncle
You niece
In ten days time if youre found within twenty miles of the court youll die for it
Please your Grace tell me what crime I have committed
If I know my own thoughts and desires and Im not dreaming or crazywhich Im sure Im notthen dear uncle Ive never had so much as a halfformed thought that would have offended you
All traitors protest like this
If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent theyd all be as innocent as God Himself
I dont trust you
You are your fathers daughter
Thats enough
I was his daughter when your Highness took my fathers dukedom
I was his daughter when you banished him
My father wasnt a traitor
So please my lord dont assume that Im treacherous just because Im poor with no titles to my name
Dear master listen to me
Yes Celia we kept her here for your sake
I was too young at the time to appreciate her value but now I know her
If shes a traitor why then so am I
Youre a fool
You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when shes out of the picture
So be quiet
The sentence Ive passed down on her is firm and unshakeable
She is banished
Then lay that sentence on me too my lord
I cannot live without her
You are a foolYou niece prepare to leave
On my honor and by my word if you outstay the ten days you will die
Oh my poor Rosalind where will you go
Do you want to exchange fathers
Ill give you mine
I insist dont be more distressed than I am
I have more reason to be distressed
Hey you
What are you  Nothing
Ive never been taught how to make anything
Well then what are you messing up
Im helping  Indeed sir find something better to do and get lost for a while
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them
When did I  Do you know where you are sir
Yes sir very wellIm here in your orchard
Do you know whom youre talking to
Yes better than you know me
I know youre my oldest brother and deserve more respect
I have as much of our father in me as you do though I admit youre closer to him and matter more because youre older
No you havent cousin
Please be cheerful
Dont you realize the duke has also banished me his daughter
No he hasnt
Oh he hasnt
Well then you dont have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one
Will we be separated
Should we part sweet girl
I swear by the heavens which have grown pale in sympathy with us Im going with you whatever you say
But where will we go
To the Forest of Arden to find your father
But what danger well put ourselves in two young innocent women traveling so far
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money
Ill put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt
Wouldnt it be bettersince Im unusually tall for a womanto dress myself like a man
Ill wear a big sword in my belt carry a boarspear in my hand and hide all my womanish fear in my heart
What should I call you when youre a man
Ill take no lesser name than that of  Something that refers to my current state
Instead of Celia call me Aliena
Wouldnt he be a comfort to us in our travels
Lets go gather our jewels and money
Well figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my fathers guards whom hell send out as soon as he discovers Ive gone
Now we go contentedly to freedomnot banishment
Now my companions and brothers in exile hasnt experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance
Arent these woods less perilous than the court with all its jealousies and intrigues
I smile and think Thank goodness the wind doesnt flatter me its like a councilor who makes me feel what Im really made of Adversity can have its benefitslike the ugly poisonous  I wouldnt change my situation for anything
Youre lucky my lord to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you
Come shall we hunt some deer for dinner
It bothers me though that these poor spotted innocents who after all are this deserted citys native citizens should be gouged with arrows
Indeed my lord the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths
Big round tears ran piteously down the animals innocent nose
And did you leave him like this
We did my lord weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer
Take me to him
I love to argue with him when hes having one of these fits because then he always has a lot to say
Ill bring you to him right away
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave
It cannot be
Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen
I cant find anyone who saw her leave
Her ladiesinwaiting saw her go to bed and early this morning the bed was empty
My lord that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing
Send a message to his brother
Bring that swinger Orlando here
If hes not around bring his brother Oliver to me
Ill make Oliver find him
Do this immediately and dont stop searching and interrogating until youve brought home these foolish runaways
Whos there
What are you doing here
Why are you so strong and good
Why do people love you
And why are you noble strong and brave
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody dukes favorite champion
Your praise has beaten you home
Dont you know master that some mens best qualities do them in
Oh what a world this is when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him
Why whats the matter
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you
Oliver your brotherno not your brother and yet hes the sonbut no I wont call him the sonof that great man I was about to call his father has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match and tonight hes planning on burning your house down with you in it
And if he fails at that he will find other ways to kill you
I overheard him and his plans
This is no place for you this home is now a slaughterhouse
Hate it fear it do not come inside
Then where would you have me go Adam
It doesnt matter where so long as its not here
What would you have me beg for my food
This is all thats left for me to do but I wont do it
Id rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers
But dont do that
Let me be your servant
I know I may be old but Im strong and healthy because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly
Therefore my old age is like a blustery winter cold but kindly
Let me go with you
Ill do everything a younger man could do for you
Oh good old man youre a great example of that old work ethic where people worked because it was their duty not just for the money
Come along though
Well go together and before weve spent all the savings of your youth well find a way to make a living
Go on master and I will follow youwith truth and loyalty to my last breath
From the time I was seventeen over sixty years ago I have lived in this house but now I will live here no more
Many men seek their fortune at seventeen at eighty its a bit late
But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well without owing my master anything
Oh Lord my spirits are tired
I wouldnt care about my spirits if my legs werent tired
I cant go any further
Id rather bear with you than  Well this is the Forest of Arden
Yes now Im in Arden and that makes me the bigger fool
Yes be content good Touchstone
Look whos coming a young man and an old man having a serious talk
What you dare put your hands on me villain
Im no villain
If you werent my brother Id leave this hand of mine on your neck until Id pulled out your tongue for talking like this
Youve only insulted yourself
Gentlemen calm down
For the sake of your fathers memory make peace
Let me go I say
I wont until Im ready
You will listen to me
My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education
But youve raised me as a peasant hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman
My fathers spirit is growing in me and I wont take this any longer
And what are you going to do after youve spent your money
Well sir go inside
Im not going to be bothered by you for long
Youll get some of what you want
Now please leave me alone
What youre doing is the way to make her scorn you continually
Oh Corin I wish you could understand how much I love her
Im sure I can guess
No Corin since youre old you cannot guesseven if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was sighing and mooning all night long
If your love was anything like mineand Im sure that no man has loved as I love nowexactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to
Oh a thousand of them all of which Ive forgotten
Oh then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me
If you cant remember the stupidest little thing love made you do you havent loved
Or if you havent sat as I do now boring your listener with all your lovers virtues then you havent loved
Or if you havent broken away from human company as my feelings now lead me to do you havent loved
O Phoebe Phoebe Phoebe
Oh poor shepherd
Me too
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword on a stone and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile
I remember kissing her washing stick and the cows udders that her pretty chapped hands had milked
I remember wooing a pea plant in her name and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them for my sake Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things
But everything that lives is mortal including the foolishness of love
You speak more wisely than you know
Nah Ill never be aware of my own wit until I break my shins on it
By God
And like mine but Im getting a little tired of it
Please one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him
Shut up fool
Hes not your relative
Whos calling
Your superiors
Please sir if love or money can buy anything in this empty place tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves
Dear sir I pity the lady and wishmore for her sake than my ownthat I was more able to help her
But Im a hired hand I dont profit from the flocks I tend
Besides his cottage his flocks and his grazing rights are on sale now and since hes not there theres nothing to eat at our house
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture
That young man who was just here
Please if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man buy the cottage pasture and flock for us and well pay you for it
And we will raise your wages
The thing is definitely going to be sold
Come with me
If you like what you see of the land the profit thats possible and this rustic life Ill be your faithful servant and buy the place with your gold right away
More more please more
Its only going to make you sad Monsieur Jaques
Im glad about that
More please more
I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs
More please more
My voice is ragged
I know I wont please you
Come on another stanzais that what you call em stanzas
Nah I dont care what their 
Well then if Ive ever thanked a man Ill thank you now
But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together
The duke will drink under this treeHes been looking for you all day you know
And Ive been avoiding him all day
Hes too argumentative for me
I think of as many things as he does but I just thank heaven and dont show off about it
Come warble for me
I wrote a verse to this tune though its not very imaginative
Dear master I cant go any farther
Oh Im dying of hunger
Ill lie down here and measure out my grave
Farewell kind master
Hey whats this Adam
No braver than this
Live a little be comforted a little cheer up a little
If I can find any animal in this wild forest Ill either be food for it or bring it as food for you
Youre not as close to death as you think you are
Ill be back soon and if I havent brought you anything to eat I will give you permission to die
But if you die before I return youll have made a mockery of my efforts
There we go
You look happier already and Ill be back quickly
But youre lying out in the cold
Cheer up good Adam
I think he must have turned into an animal because I cant find him anywhere looking like a man
My lord he just left here
He was happy here listening to a song
If that man whos made up of conflicts becomes musical then there must be something wrong with the universe
Go find him
Tell him I want to speak with him
He saved me the trouble here he comes
Well whats going on mister
What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company
What you look amused
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and looking at it solemnly said Its ten oclock
This way we can see how the world moves
Only an hour ago it was nine and in another hour it will be eleven
Oh noble fool
A worthy fool
Motley is the only thing to wear
Who is this fool
A worthy fool
God bless my old master
He would never have spoken to me like this
Is that how its going to be
Are you starting to challenge me
Ill cure you of your insolence and Im not going to give you a thousand crowns eitherHey Dennis
Did you call for me your Worship
Wasnt Charles the dukes wrestler here to speak with me
Yes sir hes here at the door right now and asks to see you
Call him in
I have a good plan
Like the wind I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please as fools do
And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest
Why sir must he
Well its as plain as the beaten path to a parish church
Dress me up in motley
Let me speak my mind and Ill rid the world of its sicknessif it will only tolerate my medicine
To hell with you
I know what youd do
What would I do besides good
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning because you yourself have been a terrible sinner as carnal in your appetites as lust itself and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large
Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her
And when some lowlife protests that  Stop and eat no more
But I havent eaten anything yet
And you wont until the needy eat
What kind of fighting cock is this
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners
You were right the first time
But stop I say
If you wont listen to reason Ill have to die
What would you like
Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does
Im dying for food so let me have some
Sit down and eat and welcome to our table
Do you really speak like such a gentleman
I beg your pardon
I thought everything out here was wild which is why I acted so stern and commanding
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good mens feasts and cried tears of pitytherefore sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs
Then please put off your eating for a little while I like a mother doe find my fawn and bring it food
There is a poor old man who purely out of love has limped after me for miles
Thank you and God bless you for your hospitality
You see were not alone in our unhappiness
The whole world is a stage and all the men and women merely actors
They have their exits and their entrances and in his lifetime a man will play many parts his life separated into seven acts
In the first act he is an infant whimpering and puking in his nurses arms
Then hes the whining schoolboy with a book bag and a bright young face creeping like a snail unwillingly to school
Hes full of wise sayings and uptotheminute anecdotes thats the way he plays his part
Welcome
Set the honorable old man down and let him eat
I thank you very much on his behalf
Welcome
Eat
I wont trouble you yet with questions about your situationSome music please and good friend sing
Times not the one in debt
Your logic is so foolish
Take it to your master and bring him home immediately
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend and every one of them knows my name
Some of them give me money some invite me places some thank me for the kind things Ive done for them some try to sell me things
Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements
These are tricks of the imagination and this place is filled with magicians
Heres the money you wanted master
Whos this Adam you speak of
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden but the Adam from the jailhouse
I dont know what youre talking about
No
You mean an officer
Yes the leader of the team the one that gets you if you cant pay a debt the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them Have arrest Well sir stop your joking there
Are any ships leaving tonight
Can we go
Why sir I told you an hour ago that the good ship  This fellows gone mad and so have I Were in some kind of dream world
Please somebody get us out of here
Good to see you Master Antipholus
I see youve met with the jeweler
Is that chain youre wearing the one you promised to give to me
Get away from me Satan
Dont try to tempt me
Master is this Satans mistress
Shes the devil
No shes worse shes the devils mother and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench
But fire also gives off light and fire will burn you
You and your servant are very funny sir
Will you come with me
Can we finish our lunch
Master if you eat with her bring really long silverware
Why Dromio
Some  Now listen either give me my ring or give me the necklace
I hope youre not trying to cheat me
Come Dromio lets go
Mistress you know about that
Antipholus has gone insane no question about it
He has a ring of mine worth forty ducats and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it
Now he wont give me either
The reason I think hes insane besides the way he just acted is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house
His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits hes having
I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring
Its my best option I cant afford to lose forty ducats
Ive spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia
However Ill do what I can for you
I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus
I will
Dont worry man I wont try to escape
I tell you this will make her angry when she hears about it
Heres my servant
I think hes got the money
Hello there sir
Do you have what I told you to get
Yes
But wheres the money
Why sir I spent it on this rope
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price
Why did I just send you home
And here I am with that piece
And Ill use that piece of rope to welcome you with 
Good sir calm down
Hold your tongue
No you should tell him to hold his hands
I wish I were senseless sir so that I wouldnt feel your punches
The only thing you can sense are punchesjust like an ass
I am an ass indeed you can tell by my long ears
I figure that once hes crippled me Ill beg by showing off my beatings
Thats enough
My wifes coming
Mistress think about your endbeware of your death
EPHESUS Now what do you think
Your husbands mad isnt he
Hes trembling in his fit
I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven
Shut up you doddering old wizard
Im not possessed
Oh I wish you werent you poor frightened soul
Listen hussyis this man one of your customers
Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house
Ate at home
You there rogue what do you have to say about that
I swear sir you did not eat at home
My doors were locked and I was shut out right
By God your doors were locked and you were shut out
And she screamed at me right
No lieshe screamed at you
And her cook yelled mocked and teased me right
And I departed in a rage right
You truly did
Good idea
I gave it to Dromio who rushed in for it
You gave money to me
Didnt you go to her for a purse full of ducats
He did and I gave it to him
And I saw her do it
I was sent for a rope
Mistress both the man and his master are possessed
I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look
We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room
My sweet husband I did not lock you out
And my sweet master I received no gold
But I agree sir that we were locked out
Keep him away from me
We need more help
The devil in him is strong
jailer im your prisoner
are you going to let them break me out of jail
Gentlemen let go of him
Hes my prisoner and you cant have him
Tie up the servant for he is mad as well
Hes my prisoner
If I let him go Ill have to pay his bail fees myself
Ill pay you
Take me to the man my husband is in debt to
What a horrible day
What a horrible slut
Master Im all tied up for you
The poor soulshow strangely they talk
Angelo the jeweler
Do you know him
I know him
Two hundred ducats
For what
For a necklace your husband had him make
He said he was going to buy me a necklace but I never saw it
I need to hear the truth about all this
God have mercy on us
And theyve got their swords unsheathed
Lets call for help and get them tied up again
Lets get out of here
Theyll kill us
It looks like these witches are scared of swords
The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you
I wish we were safely on board our ship already
Look lets stay here tonight
Nobody will hurt us
You see how kind everyone is to us how they just hand us gold
I think this country is so kind that if it werent for
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself
I wouldnt stay here tonight for the entire town
Go and get our stuff onto the ship
Whats this mans reputation like here in the city
Id trust him with everything I own
Youre right
And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didnt have
Good sir stay close to me
So tell people that youre from Epidamnum–otherwise all your goods will be confiscated
Heres the money you asked me to hold
Dromio bring this money to the Centaur Inn where were lodging and wait there until I come
Itll be lunchtime within an hour
Until then Ill walk around town peruse the markets and gaze upon the buildings and then Ill return and sleep at the inn
Get going now
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money
Often when Im dulled by worry and melancholy he lightens my mood with his merry pranks
Listen will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn
But if
I got it from youI never said I didnt
Yes you did sir
Who heard me do that
My own ears heard it and you know it
To hell with you
Its a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men
Youre a villain to say this about me
Ill prove that Im an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself
I do dare and I say that you are the villain
Run master run
For Gods sake find a house to duck into
This looks like an abbey
Go in or were done for
Be quiet people
Why have you come here in such a mob
To get my poor mad husband out from inside there
Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover
How long has he been possessed like this
This week he was sad moody and depressed and very different from his usual self
But it wasnt until this afternoon that he broke out into violence
Thats a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander
Which of these bad things happened to him
You should have reprimanded him for that
I did
Fine but you werent harsh enough
You scolded him in private
And in public too
Fine but not enough
He couldnt eat without me talking about it
All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was
And thats why he went crazy
A jealous womans poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog
You seasoned his food with screams
Fever as we know is a kind of madness
Ruining his meals his enjoyment and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad
What Im saying is your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity
Gentlemen go in there and grab him
Then have your servants bring him out
Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows it is a charitable duty my order performs
Therefore depart and leave him here with me
Be quiet and depart
Youre not going to take him
Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke
Come with me
Ill fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey
Its almost five oclock
To see an elderly unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus
Here they come
We will watch the execution
Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey
One more time we proclaim this publicly If anyone will pay this mans bail he will not be put to death
Duke the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice
Shes a virtuous and holy lady
She cant possibly have done you any wrong
So please most gracious duke order her to bring him out so we can get him some help
And when you married him and made him the master of your bed I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him
Shut up fool
Your master and his servant are here
Mistress I swear on my life that its true
It was just moments ago
Hes crying out for you and swears hell burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you
Oh my its my husband
Look he can become invisible
Just now we put him in the abbey over here and now hes over there
In exchange for the blood I shed for you then I ask you for justice now
The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination
Today great duke she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores
Thats terrible
No my good lord
I ate with him and my sister
Damn my soul if these accusations are true
If shes lying I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day
Oh lying woman
My lord I know what Im saying
He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine where I was dining with Balthasar
He hadnt arrived by the time we finished eating so I went out looking for him
I met him in the streethe was there with that man
On the way we came across my wife her sister and their gang of vile associates
One of them was a man named Pinch a hungry narrowfaced villain a skeleton a fraud a raggedy magician and fortuneteller a needy holloweyed emaciated wretch a walking corpse
He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse
They left me and my servant there tied together
He did my lord
I never saw the necklace so help me heaven
Why what a complicated case this is
it pleases you Ill meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime
Right now my pressing business calls me away
Farewell till then
I will go lose myself wandering up and down throughout the city
Sir I leave you to your own contentment
He leaves me to my own contentment but thats the one thing I cannot find
Out in the world Im like a drop of water trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean
In order to find a mother and a brother I too have lost myself unhappily
How is it that youve come back so soon
Back so soon
Too late is more like it
The chicken is burning the pig is overcooked the clock has already struck twelve and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek
ate at home but the jeweler says he didnt
Sir he ate with this woman at the Porcupine
He did and he snatched my ring right off my finger
Thats true my lord I did get this ring from her
Did you see him enter this abbey
As clearly as I see you my lord
I think youre all either bewildered or stark raving mad
Mighty duke please allow me to say something
I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life
I was bound to him an hour ago sir but thankfully he chewed through our ropes
Now Im Dromio and no longer attached to him
Im sure you both remember me
Youre not one of Pinchs patients are you sir
Why are you looking at me so strangely
You know me well
I never saw you before in my life
Oh grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me
But tell me this dont you know my voice
No
Dont you Dromio
No sir trust me I do not
You dont know my voice
Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak sorrowravaged voice
But I still have a little memory left and theres still some fire in my eyes my dull deaf ears can still hear a little
All these aging faculties tell meand I cannot be wrongthat you are my son Antipholus
I never saw my father in my life
You know that we parted only seven years ago in Syracuse
Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things
Mighty duke look here and see a man whos been treated most terribly
Either my eyes deceive me or I see two husbands
I sir am Dromio
Command this man to leave
I sir am Dromio
Pray let me stay
Oh my old masterWho tied him up
Tell us old Egeon are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia who gave birth to two fair sons
Oh if you are the same Egeon speak now and speak to that same Emilia
These two Antipholuses who look so alikeand these two Dromios who seem to have the same faceand her story of being shipwreckedwhy these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident
If Im not dreaming you are Emilia
If its really you tell me what happened to our son who floated away with you on that deadly raft
Antipholus arent you originally from Corinth
Wait dont stand next to each other
I cant tell whos who
I came from Corinth Your Highness
And I came with him
Your renowned uncle Duke Menaphon the famous soldier brought me here
Which of you two ate lunch with me today
I did kind lady
And youre my husband right
Thats the necklace I gave you sir
I think it is sir
I dont deny it
And you sir had me arrested over that necklace
I think I did sir
I dont deny it
I sent Dromio to you with money for bail but I dont think he brought it to you
No he didnt get any by me
I got this purse full of money from you and my Dromio brought it to me
I want to use this money to set my father free
Thats not necessary
Im going to let him live
Sir I must get that diamond ring back from you
There take it and thanks for taking such good care of me
Renowned duke please join us in the abbey where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us
Duke Solinus my husband and both my childrenand you two Dromios who marked the day of my sons births with your owncome into the abbey with me for a new christening
After such a long period of grief we will have such a celebration
With all my heart Ill join you
Dromio what stuff of mine did you put on a ship
The stuff you had at the Centaur sir
Im your master Dromio
You have a fat friend at your masters house she took care of me in the kitchen today thinking I was you
I guess now shes going to be my sisterinlaw and not my wife
I think youre my mirror not my brother
Do you want to go in and join the party
After you sir
Youre older than me
Thats a good point
How can we tell which of us is the oldest
Well draw straws
Meanwhile after you
We came into the world as brother and brother so now lets enter hand in handnot one before the other
Hold on a second
Answer me this please wheres the money I gave you
Oh the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress
The saddle maker has it sirI didnt keep it
Im not in a joking mood
Tell me right now and stop fooling wheres the money
Were strangers here
Please sir crack jokes over lunch
I should think that your appetite would act like a clock as mine does and bring you home on its own without the need for a messenger
Thats enough Dromio please
This isnt a good moment for jokessave them till a happier time
Wheres the gold I gave you
Gave me sir
You didnt give me any gold
Tell me what youve done with the money I entrusted to you
The only thing that Ive been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house the Phoenix for lunch
My mistress and her sister are waiting for you
Tell me where youve stowed away my money or I swear Ill break that comical head of yours for goofing when Im not in the mood
Where are the thousand 
Your mistresss marks
What mistress do you have
What are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to
There take that you scoundrel
What are you doing
Stop for Gods sake
Well if you dont then Im out of here
I swear somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money
They say that this town is full of deceptionillusionists that can fool the eye dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind soulkilling witches who can disfigure your body disguised swindlers fasttalking fakers and all kinds of other unchecked sins
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned even though I sent the slave off running
Surely Luciana its already two oclock
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch
Sister lets eat and stop worrying
A man is master of his own freedom time is his only master and when the right moment comes along hell come or go as he pleases
If this is so be patient sister
Why should men be more free than women
Because their business lies outside the home
Why too much freedom leads to woe
Therefore you should obey their wishes
Its this servantlike mentality thats keeping you unmarried
No thats not itits because of what happens in the marriage bed
But if you were married youd wield some influence
Before I learn how to love Ill learn how to follow orders
What if your husband strays elsewhere
Id endure it until he came home again
Now thats patience
No wonder shes waiting to get married
When were faced with a wretched person bruised and crying with hardship we try to get them to shush up
But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights this foolish patience will abandon you
Well Ill get married one day just to see
Tell me is your tardy master close at hand
Do you know his plans
But please tell me is he coming home
It seems he has taken great care to please his wife
Why mistress my master is as angry as a bull with horns
You bastard
I dont mean hes 
My mistress I said
Damn your mistress
My master said it
I dont know he said any house wife or mistress My message which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth ended up being carried back home by my shoulders
Go back again slave and bring him home
Go back again to be beaten home again
For Gods sake send somebody else
Go back slave or Ill knock you one across the head
Get out of here you blathering peasant
Bring your master home
You kick me out he kicks me back
Look at you
You have impatience all over your face
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him
Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks
Have I lost my wit
One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty
But like an unruly deer hes always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures
I am nothing but a poor used fool
Drive it out of you
I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman or why wouldnt he be here
Sister you know he promised to give me a necklace
I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me
Even the best jewel can be tarnished
And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior
Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband Ill weep away whats left and then die with weeping
How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy
Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles
Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns
No–the law goes further if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuses marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus that man dies and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself
Therefore by law you are condemned to die
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me
I havent spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier
Here he comes
So sir
Are you over your ridiculous mood
You never heard of the Centaur
You werent given any gold
Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner
The Phoenix is my house
Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly
Said what sir
When did I say all that
I havent seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me
And I hope you realized I wasnt very happy about it
Im glad to see you in such a merry mood
But whats the joke
Please master tell me
What are you mocking me to my face
Here
Take that and that
Stop sir for Gods sake
Now this joke has turned serious
Why are you doing this
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me you try to take advantage of my affection
You call it my  Dont you know
Should I tell you why
Well thank you
Because you gave me something for nothing
Next time Ill give you nothing for something
Is it lunchtime
What would that be
A basting
Well then it will be dry
If it is I suggest you dont eat it
Why not
Because it will make you angry and that will get me another beating
Well learn to make jokes at the appropriate time
Theres a time for all things
Before you got so angry I never would have thought that
Why not
Ill tell you its because of a law as plain as Father Times bald head
Lets hear it
There may be a time for everything but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back
Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair
But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence
So then you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded
Two reasons
And good ones too
Not good ones please
Then sure ones
No not sure ones when were talking about something unsure
Then certain ones
Name them
One so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling and two so that when their hair falls out it doesnt land in their dinner
You were supposed to be proving that there isnt time for everything
Then Ill change it to this Father Time himself is bald so for all time there will be bald men
There was a time when youd freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it
How is it my husbandoh how is itthat you have become a stranger to yourself
Ah dont tear yourself away from me
I dont know you
Why are you treating my sister like this
She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch
Dromio
And this is what you told me he said that he beat you and pretended his house wasnt his and I wasnt his wife
Did you talk with this woman
What kind of scheme do you have going together
Me sir
I never saw her till now
You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace
I never talked with her in my life
What was I married to her in a dream
Or am I asleep now and imagining all this
What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely
Until I know for sure Ill humor her
Dromio tell the servants to prepare for lunch
Oh I wish I had my rosary
Ill cross myself
This must be some kind of fairyland
Oh spite of spites
If we dont obey them theyll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue
Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you
Dromio you drone you snail you slug you idiot
Ive been transformed somehow havent I master
No master Ive been changed in both mind and body
Thats true
I must be as stupid as an assthats why I dont know her but she knows me
I wont play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me
Come husband lets go to lunch
Husband Ill eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks youve pulled
Am I on earth in heaven or in hell
know myself
Master should I watch the door
Yes and dont let anyone come in or else Ill break your head
Well Syracusian tell us–briefly–why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus
And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad
In the same hour and in the same inn a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys
Reluctantly I agreed–alas
Too quickly we boarded a ship
Signior Angelo please excuse us
Heres the story well tell her that I was with you at your shop watching you make her necklace and that youre going to deliver it tomorrow
But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him told him Id given him a thousand marks in gold and then lied about my wife and my house
Say what you want but I know what I know
I think youre an ass
Signior Balthasar you look upset
Your delicacies arent worth as much to me as your welcome is
Good foods not a big dealeveryone can afford that
And everyone can say welcome which is just a word
A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast
Sure to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest
But look even if my dishes are poor eat them with my best wishes
You may come across better food but not a warmer welcome
Whats this
My door is locked
Maud Bridget Marian Ciceley Gillian Ginn
My master is standing out in the street
Whos in there
Hey open the door
A reason
So I can eat lunch
I havent eaten today
Who do you think you are keeping me out of my own house
Youve stolen both my job and my name
Oh Lord this makes me laugh
Ill come at you with the old proverb Should I make myself at home  
Listen up you slave
Are you going to let us in
Come help me bang on the door master
Well done
We answered them blow for blow
You goodfornothing let me in
Master knock hard upon the door
If I break the door down slave youll be sorry for this
Is that you wife
You could have come sooner
If she punishes you master shes sure to punish me
We argued about which was best and now we wont get either one
And if your clothes were as thin as mine youd really feel the air
The food inside is warm but youre out here freezing
It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this
Go get me something I can use to break down the door
Ive had enough of this off with you Come on let me in
Well Im going to break in
Go get me a crow
A crow without feathers
Master do you really mean that
I meant a crowbar
Get going already
Be patient sir
Dont do this
All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you
Lets assume that she has a reason which you dont know yet have faith that shell eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today
Youre rightIll go quietly
And even though Im in a distasteful mood Ill work on being happy
I know a terrific wench
Well eat at her place
I swear to her that I havent but it doesnt change anything
Ill meet you there in an hour
Do that
This little prank of hers is going to cost me
Is the building of your love already in ruins
If you married my sister for her wealth then for her wealths sake treat her with more kindness
What foolish thief brags about his crimes
Its doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes
We follow in your orbit and you have the power to move us
So my sweet brotherinlaw go inside
Sweet mistressI dont know what other name to give you or how youve figured out mineyou seem as
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine
Teach me how I should think and speak
Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction
Are you a god
Are you trying to remake me
Go ahead Ill yield to your power
But if I am myself then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife
I dont owe her any dutyits you that I submit to
Oh sweet mermaid dont command me to drown myself in the flood of your sisters tears
Are you insane talking like this
Your eyes are playing tricks on you
Thats because you are near me and youre as dazzling as the sun
Why are you calling me love
Call my sister that
Your sisters sister
Thats my sister
My food my fortune my sweetest hope my heaven on earth and my entrance to heaven
My sister is all those things or else she should be
Call yourself your own sister because I want you
Give me your hand
Oh wait sir
Stay here
Ill go get my sister and see what she thinks
Whats going on Dromio
Where are you running so fast
Do you know me
Am I Dromio
Am I your servant
Am I myself
It carried us toward Corinth–or so we thought
But before they reached us–let me say no more
You are Dromio you are my servant and you are yourself
Im an ass Im a womans servant and Im beside myself
What womans servant
What do you mean beside yourself
How does she claim to own you
I dont mean that she wants me because  Whats she like
The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by
Her
Even if she lives till the end of the world shed keep burning an additional week
Whats her skin like
Its dark like my shoe
Some water will fix that
No its permanent
Whats her name
Nell
Shes round like a globe
What part of her body is Ireland
Her bottom
Honestly I didnt see it but I felt it in her hot breath
Wheres America and the West Indies
Oh sir on her nose which is covered with pimples sores and red welts
And I think that if I hadnt been brave and strong she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave
If theres enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight I wont spend tonight in this town
If a ships leaving come to the marketplace
If everyone here knows us but we dont know anybody its time I think for us to pack our bags and take off
Ill run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as Id run from a bear
That means its high time for me to go
That woman who claims I am her husbandI loathe her in my soul
Id better stop up my ears against this sirens song
I know that sir
Look heres the necklace
What do you want me to do with this
Whatever you wantI made it for you
Made it for me
I didnt order it
You didnot just once or twice but twenty times
Youre a funny man sir
Take care
I dont know what to think about this
Ill go wait for Dromio at the marketplace
If any ships are sailing Ill get right on one
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you
At five oclock hes going to pay me for it
Please come to his house with me
The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman
Please pay him immediately
I dont have the cash right now
Besides I have some business to take care of in town
So youll bring the necklace to her yourself
All right sir I will
Do you have it with you
Listen please give me the necklace
The wind is right and its high tide and Ive delayed him a long time already
Good Lord
Youre using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised
I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it but you started fighting with me first
Its getting late
Please sir hurry up
Antipholus you hear how the man pleads with me
Give me the necklace
Give it to my wife and get your money
Come come
You know I gave it to you just now
Send the necklace to her or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me
Damn it this isnt funny
Wheres the necklace
Let me see it
Pay you
What should I pay you
The money you owe me for the necklace
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago
You wrong me even more sir by denying it
Consider how poorly this reflects on me
I will
This harms my reputation
Pay for something I never got
Go ahead you fool
Arrest me if you dare
I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly
Youre under arrest sir
You hear the charges
Ill obey you until I can make bail
But Angelo youll pay for this even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop
Sir the laws of Ephesus will be on my side and youll be embarrassed
No keep going old man dont stop like that
For we may take pity on you even if we cant pardon you
Had the gods taken pity on us I wouldnt be here calling them merciless
Its been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes
And for the sake of those you grieve for do me a favor tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them up to this point
Ive left our luggage on the ship and I bought the oil balm and liquor you wanted
You annoying idiot what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me
A ship you sent me to find to book passage out of here
You drunken slave I sent you for a rope and I told you what to do with it
Yeah rightyou sent me to get whipped
You sent me to the port to find a ship
Ill debate this with you later and then Ill teach you to listen more carefully
Go to Adriana you scoundrel and quickly
Give her this key and tell her that theres money in the desk thats covered with a Turkish tapestry
Have her send it to me
Tell her that Ive been arrested and the money will be my bail
Hurry you slave
Go
To Adriana
Where that sweetheart said I was her husband
Shes too much for me to handle
But I must go there against my will servants must fulfill their masters wishes
Oh Luciana did he tempt you like that
Sad or happy
First he said you had no right to him
He meant he did nothing right for mewhich is true unfortunately
Then he swore he was a stranger here
And thats truehe  Then I pleaded for you
And what did he say
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you
How did he try to persuade you to love him
Have some patience please
Then why be jealous of a person like that
When an evil thing has been lost no one cries
Oh but I think of him more highly than I say I doand I wish he looked worse in other womens eyes
My heart adores him even though my tongue curses him
How did you lose your breath
By running fast
Wheres your master Dromio
Is he all right
No hes in a place worse than hell
A backbiting friend one who grabs people who patrols the streets and passageways
Speak man whats the matter
Tell me who had him arrested
I dont know who had him arrested but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather
Get it sister
How could he be in debt without me knowing it
Dont you hear it ring
What the necklace
No no the bell
Its time for me to go
It was two oclock when I left him and now its one
Ive never heard of that
Of course
You sell fish
No not me sir
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller
Good sir
Yes sir
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world
Thats definitely true my lord
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog kissing the corpseby the way do you have a daughter
I do indeed my lord
Then by all means never let her walk in public
Procreation is a good thing but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out friend
A lot of words
And what is the subject
Between whom
I mean what do the words say
Oh just lies sir
Into my grave
Well thats certainly out of this world all right
You cant take anything from me that I care less aboutexcept my life except my life except my life
Goodbye my lord
Youre looking for Lord Hamlet
Hes right over there
Thank you sir
My lord
My dear sir
Ah my good old friends
How are you Guildenstern
And Rosencrantz
Boys how are you both doing
Happy that were not too happy lucky in being not too lucky
But youre not down and out either are you
So youre around Lady Lucks waist
Yes were the privates in her army
Anyway whats up
But youre wrong
Let me ask you a particular question
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison
Prison my lord
Denmarks a prison
Then I guess the whole world is one
Yes quite a large one with many cells and dungeons Denmark being one of the worst
We dont think so my lord
Well then it isnt one to you since nothing is really good or bad in itselfits all what a person thinks about it
And to me Denmark is a prison
That must be because youre so ambitious
Its too small for your large mind
Dreams are a sign of ambition since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream
But a dream itself is just a shadow
In fact I consider ambition to be so light and airy that its only the shadow of a shadow
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars
Should we go inside
Well then I thank you though Im such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much
Or was it just your whim on your own initiative
What should we say my lord
You were sent for
I know the king and queen sent for you
Why would they do that my lord
Thats what I want you to tell me
My lord we were sent for
Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day
Who can explain this to me
I can
Or at least I can describe the rumors
So why did you laugh when I said that men dont interest me
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome
The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield the lover will be rewarded for his sighs the crazy character can rant all he wants the clown will make everybody laugh and the lady character can say whatevers on her mind or Ill stop the play
Which troupe is it
The tragic actors from the city the ones you used to enjoy so much
What are they doing on the road
They made more money and got more attention in the city
But things have changed there and its easier for them on the road now
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city
Do they attract big audiences
No not like before
Why
Are they getting rusty
No theyre busy and as excellent as ever
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it
These child actors are now in fashion and theyve so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all theyre so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys
What you mean kid actors
Who takes care of them
Who pays their way
Will they stop working when their voices mature
Arent the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors which they are going to grow up and become
Theres been a whole debate on the topic
For a while no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the childrens playwright and the actors playing adult roles
Are you kidding
Oh theres been a lot of quarreling
And the boys are winning so far
Actually its not so unusual when you think about it
My uncle is king of Denmark and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him
Theres something downright unnatural about it if a philosopher stopped to think about it
The actors are here
Gentlemen welcome to Elsinore
Dont be shyshake hands with me
And if we dont shake hands when I act all nice to the players it will seem like Im happier to see them than you
You are very welcome here
But still my unclefather and auntmother have got the wrong idea
In what sense my lord
Im only crazy sometimes
At other times I know whats what
Gentlemen I hope you are well
Listen Guildenstern and you too Rosencrantzlisten as close as you can
Yes the second time around since as they say old people become children again
My lord I have news for you
My lord I have news for you
When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome  The actors have arrived my lord
Yawn snore
I swear each actor arrived on his ass
Well        Arent I right Jephthah old man
If youre calling me Jephthah my lord I do have a daughter I love more than anything yes
What is logical then my lord
Why
Welcome welcome to all of you
Which speech my lord
But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play with wellordered scenes that were clever but not fancy 
I loved one speech in particular
This speech is going on too long
Well have the barber trim it later along with your beard
The muffled queen
Thats good
The muffled queen is good
Look how flushed the actor is with tears in his eyes
My lord I will give them all they deserve
Good heavens man give them more than that
Treat them with honor and dignity
The less they deserve the more your generosity is worth
Lead them inside
Come everyone
Follow him friends
Well watch a whole play tomorrow
Yes my lord
Then well see that tomorrow night
By the way if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play you could learn it by heart for tomorrow right
Yes my lord
Very well
Follow that gentleman now and be careful not to make fun of him
My good friends Ill see you tomorrow
Welcome to Elsinore
Yes my lord
Now Im alone
Oh what a mean lowlife I am
For Hecuba
The ghost is definitely something to worry about
In the high and mighty Roman Empire just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish
Wait look
It has come again
Ill meet it if its the last thing I do
If you have a voice or can make sounds speak to me
Am I a coward
Pull off my beard
Pinch my nose
Call me the worst liar
Bloody inhuman villain
Remorseless treacherous sexobsessed unnatural villain
Ah revenge
What an ass I am
Damn it
Murder has no tongue but miraculously it still finds a way to speak
If he becomes pale I know what to do
I need better evidence than the ghost to work with
The plays the thing to uncover the conscience of the king
And you cant put your heads together and figure out why hes acting so dazed and confused ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy
Did he treat you well when you saw him
Yes in a very gentlemanly way
He didnt ask questions but answered ours at length
Madam some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here
They are here at court now and I believe theyve been told to give a performance for him tonight
Its true and he asked me to beg you both to attend
It makes me very happy to hear hes so interested
Gentlemen please try to sharpen his interest even more and let this play do him some good
We will my lord
Yes Ill go
I hope so too Madam
Ophelia come here   I hear him coming
Quick lets hide my lord
Dying sleepingthats all dying isa sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives usthats an achievement to wish for
To die to sleepto sleep maybe to dream
Thats the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long
After all who would put up with all lifes humiliationsthe abuse from superiors the insults of arrogant men the pangs of unrequited love the inefficiency of the legal system the rudeness of people in office and the mistreatment good people have to take from badwhen you could simply take out your knife and call it quits
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we dont
But  Hello my lord how have you been doing lately
Very well thank you
Well well well
My lord I have some mementos of yours that Ive been meaning to give back to you for a long time now
Please take them
There my lord
Ha ha are you good
Excuse me
Are you beautiful
My lord what are you talking about
Im just saying that if youre good and beautiful your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness
Sure since beautys power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin
This used to be a great puzzle but now Ive solved it
I used to love you
You certainly made me believe you did my lord
I didnt love you
Then I guess I was misled
Get yourself to a 
I am arrogant vengeful ambitious with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts and more than I have time to carry it out in
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven
Every one of us is a criminal
Dont believe any of us
Hurry to a convent
Wheres your father
Hes at home my lord
Lock him in so he can play the fool in his own home only
Goodbye
Oh dear God please help him
Get yourself to a convent at once
Goodbye
Goodbye
Dear God please make him normal again
Ive heard all about you women and your cosmetics too
God gives you one face but you paint another on top of it
You dance and prance and lisp you call Gods creations by pet names and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance
Come on I wont stand for it anymore
Its driven me crazy
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage
Whoever is already married except one person I know will stay marriedall but one person
Everyone else will have to stay single
Get yourself to a convent fast
Love
His feelings dont move in that direction
With any luck the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind
What do you think of this plan
It should work
But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited loveHello Ophelia
You dont have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said
Ill hide and listen in
If she cant find out what his secret is then send him off to England or wherever you think best
Thats how well do it then
If theres any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor speak to me
Or if youve got some buried treasure somewhere which they say often makes ghosts restless then tell us about it
Stay and speak
Keep it from leaving Marcellus
Should I strike it with my spear
Yes if it doesnt stand still
Its over here
There it is
Its gone
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed
Perform the speech just as I taught you musically and smoothly
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds bursting everyones eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows
I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical
Please avoid doing that
I will sir
But dont be too tame eitherlet your good sense guide you
I hope weve corrected that fault pretty well in our company sir
Oh correct it completely
Make sure that the clowns do not adlib since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed
Yes he will and the queen as well
Tell the actors to hurry
Will you two help them get ready
Yes my lord
Well hello there Horatio
Here I am at your service my dear lord
Horatio youre the best man Ive ever known
Oh sir Dont think Im flattering you
What could I hope to get from you whove got nothing but your charm to support you in life
Why would anyone flatter a poor person
No keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well
You understand
Ever since Ive been a free agent in my choice of friends Ive chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance grateful for both good and bad
Watch him closely
Theyre coming
I cant talk now
Take your seat
So hows my nephew Hamlet doing
Wonderful
I eat the air like chameleons do
Im positively stuffed with air I eat so much of it
I have no idea what youre talking about Hamlet
Youre not answering my question
Mine neither
Indeed I did my lord
What role did you play
I played Julius Caesar
I was killed in the Capitol
Brutus killed me
Yes my lord
Theyre ready whenever you are
No thanks my good mother
Theres a nicer piece of work right here
My lady should I lie in your lap
No my lord
I mean with my head in your lap
Yes my lord
Did you think I was talking about sex
What is my lord
Nothing
Youre in a good mood tonight my lord
Who me
Yes my lord
Oh Godwho is by the way the best comic of them all
What can you do but be happy
Look how cheerful my mother is only two hours after my father died
No my lord its been four months
As long as that
Ill get myself a furtrimmed suit
In that case theres reason to hope a mans memory may outlive him by six months
But hes got to build churches for that to happen my lady or else hell have to put up with being forgotten like the hobbyhorse in the popular song that goes Heighho heighho the hobbyhorse is forgotten   What does this mean my lord
This means were having some mischievous fun
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play
This guy will tell us everything
Actors cant keep a secret
Theyll tell all
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant
Sure or anything else you show him
As long as you arent ashamed to show it he wont be ashamed to tell you what it means
Youre naughty
Im watching the play
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring
It was a bit short my lord
Yes as short as a womans love
Madam how are you liking this play
The ladys overdoing it I think
Oh but shell keep her word
Is there anything offensive in it
Not offensive at all
Whats the play called
Yes it faded away when the rooster crowed
Dont you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this out of duty and love
I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me
Were all waiting for the revenge  
The original story was written in the finest Italian
Youll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzagos wife
The king is getting up
Whatis he scared of a gun that only fired a blank
My lord how are you feeling
Get me out of here
Lights lights get us some lights
No a whole share for me
Did you notice
Yes I did my lord
When the actors were talking about poison
I watched him very closely
Ah ha
Hey lets have some music here
Play your flutes
Come on music
My lord could I have a word with you
You can have a whole story not just a word
Sir the king Yes what about him
Hes in his chambers now and hes extremely upset
Ill be good sir
Go ahead
The queen your mother is upset and sent me to see you
Its lovely to see you
No my lord your polite words are not to the point
If you could please stop fooling around Ill tell you what your mother wants
If not Ill leave you alone and thatll be the end of my business
Sir I cant
Cant what my lord
Stop fooling around
My mind is confused
Okay to the point
Oh what a wonderful son I can impress my mother
But whats the upshot of her admiration
Do tell
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed
Id obey even if she were my mother ten times over
Is there anything else I can do for you
My lord you used to like me
And still do I swear by my hands
My lord whats wrong with you
Sir I have no future ahead of me
But how can you say that when the king himself says youre the heir to the Danish throne
I dont really understand what you mean
Will you play this recorder
I cant my lord
Please
Im serious I cant
Im begging you
I have no idea how
Oh its as easy as lying
But I cant play a melody
I dont know how
My God do you think Im easier to manipulate than a pipe
You can push my buttons but you cant play me for a fool
Hello and God bless you sir
My lord the queen wants to speak with you right away
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel
By God it does look like a camel
To me it looks like a weasel
It does have a back like a weasels
Or like a whale
Yes very much like a whale
Ill go see my mother soon
Ill tell her
This is the time of night when witches come out when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight
Ill speak as sharp as a dagger to her but I wont use one on her
And so my words and thoughts will be at odds
I dont like the way hes acting and its not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control
So get prepared
Im sending you to England on diplomatic business and Hamlet will go with you
As king I cannot risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour
Well take care of it
When a great leader dies he doesnt die alone but like a whirlpool draws others with him
Hes like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller thingswhen it falls down the mountain every little object goes down with it
Whenever a king sighs everyone groans
Prepare yourself please for this trip
Well put a leash on this danger thats now running wild
Well hurry
My lord Hamlets going to his mothers room
Ill hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say
I bet shell chew him out
And as you said and you said it wisely its good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them since she can be too partial to him
Goodbye my lord
Ill stop by before you go to bed and tell you what Ive heard
Thanks my dear lord
It has the mark of 
So much for Fortinbras
That wont work since Im still reaping the rewards of that murder my crown and my queen
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime
In this wicked world criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law shoving justice aside
But not in heaven
What is there left to do
But it cant help either
My hearts as black as death
My soul is stuck to sin and the more it struggles to break free the more it sticks
Help me angels
Cmon make an effort
I could do it easily now
Hes praying now
And now Ill do it 
Hell come right away
Ill be right here silent
Have you forgotten who I am
No sit down
What are you going to do
You wont kill me will you
Repent and avoid damnation
Good night to you
Who would do that
What is it Laertes
What would you like Laertes
Please let me go
I have to go to England dont you know that
What Gertrude
How is Hamlet
Oh this is terrible
His wildness is a threat to all of usto you to me to everyone
Ive gotten it dirtyashes to ashes and dust to dust
Believe what
Besides youre a sponge
You think Im a sponge my lord
Im glad about that
A thing of no importance
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment or nothing at all
But where is he
Bring him to me
At dinner
What do you mean by that
Where is Polonius
In heaven
So get ready to leave
Good
Dont waste any time
Ill tell him my lord
Go ahead then
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier
In the end I grudgingly consented
I hereby grant your request and hope you have a good time
So why does it seem so particular to you
So then the Poles wont be willing to defend it
Goodbye sir
Start without me
My God
I have the motivation the willpower the ability and the means to do it
I wont speak to her
Shes insistent
In fact shes crazed
What does she want
Show her in  
Please just listen
Oh ho
May God be at your table
Come driver
Good night ladies good night sweet ladies good night good night
Follow her
Listen
What is it
Wheres this socalled king
Please wait
Thank you
Let him go Gertrude
Wheres my father
Hes dead
Dont mess with me
Only my free willnothing else
Do you want to know who they are then
Whats that noise
Please remember love
Its not manly
And youre right to do so
Please come with me
Who are the people who want to speak with me
Sailors sir
They say they have letters for you
Show them in
Hello sir
God bless you
May He bless you too
He will sir if He wants to
I have a lot to tell you about them
Goodbye
It looks that way
I didnt see them
Laertes I want you to hear what they say
What does this mean
Do you recognize the handwriting
Naked he says
And in a PS
But let him come
Thatll be fine
All your talents and gifts didnt arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did though to me its far from your best attribute
What quality is that my lord
Yes from Normandy
Yes thats the one
I know him well
Hes his homelands jewel
How could you ask
Thats the right answerit shows your love
Lets go
Damn it
But wait whats that sound
Drowned
So she is drowned
Lets follow him Gertrude
Lets follow him
Heres the water right
Is that how the law sees it
It sure is
The coroners inquest law
Do you want to know the truth
Well there now youve said it
Come on shovel
They keep up Adams profession
What arent you a Christian
Ill ask you another question
If you cant answer it Go ahead
But how
Ah Ive got it
Go ahead
Now go and get me some booze
Yes exactly
Indeed my lord
Exactly
Theres another
Could that be a lawyers skull
No more than that my lord
Yes my lord and calfskin too
Its mine sir
For no man sir
How literal this guy is
You dont know that
Hell recover his sanity there
Why not
What do you mean in a strange way
On what grounds
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot
A leathermaker will last nine years
Whose was it
A crazy bastard
Who do you think
I really dont know
Damn that crazy madman
This one
Yes that one
Are you sad about that
Horatio tell me something
Oh God do I have to remember that
She would hang on to him and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him she couldnt get enough of him
Less than a month after my fathers death even before the tears on her cheeks had dried she remarried
Thats not good and no good can come of it either
Hello sir
Nice to see you again Horatiothat is your name right
Thats me sir
Ill change that name for you
Hello sir
Whats that my lord
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried
Exactly like that
And smelled like that too
Whew
Just as bad my lord
How low we can fall Horatio
Isnt it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel
If you thought that youd be thinking too much
No not at all
The great emperor Caesar dead and turned to clay might plug up a hole to keep the wind away
Oh to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall
But quiet be quiet a minute
Here comes the king the queen and the noblemen of court
Who are they following
Lets stay and watch a while
What other rites are you going to give her
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body
But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her
Isnt there any other rite you can perform
No nothing
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them
Lay her in the ground and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh
Im telling you you jerk priest my sister will be an angel in heaven while youre howling in hell  
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl
Goodbye
Oh damn three times damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind
Hold off burying her until Ive caught her in my arms once more
Thats no way to pray
Pull them apart
Oh my son what issue is that
I loved Ophelia
Forty thousand brothers if you added all their love together couldnt match mine
What are you going to do for her
Oh hes crazy Laertes
For the love of God be patient with him
Damn it show me what youre going to do for her
Will you cry
Fight
Stop eating
Cut yourself
Ill do all that
And if you rattle on about mountains then let them throw millions of acres over us
This is pure insanity
Hell be like this for a little while
Then hell be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch
I always loved you
But it doesnt matter
Please Horatio go with him  
Whos there
No who are  Long live the king
Is that Barnardo
Yes its me
Youve come right on time
The clocks just striking twelve
Go home to bed Francisco
Thanks for letting me go
Its bitterly cold out and Im depressed
Has it been a quiet night
I havent even heard a mouse squeak
Well good night
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight tell them to hurry
I think I hear them
Thats enough about that
Now Ill tell you the other story about my journey
Do you remember the circumstances
How could I forget my lord
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldnt let me sleep
It was worse than being a captive in chains
Is it possible
Yes please tell me
Do you want to know what I wrote
Yes my lord
I had my fathers signet ring in my pocket with the royal seal of Denmark on it
I folded up the new document signed it sealed it and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference
The next day we had our fight at sea and you know what happened after that
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it
Man they were asking for it
I dont feel guilty about them at all
They got what they deserved
Its always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents
What a king Claudius is
Isnt it completely moral to kill him now with this swordand an easy conscience
And wouldnt I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm
Hell find out soon what happened in England
Soon enough
But I have the meantime
Ill be nice to him
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury
Hang on a minutewho are you
Welcome back to Denmark my lord
Thank you kindly sir
My lord if you have a free moment I have a message from His Majesty
No thank you my lord
Its very hot
It is rather cold indeed my lord
And yet I feel its very hot and humid which is bad for my complexion
Yes indeed it is sir
Very humid I cant tell you how humid it is
My lord His Majesty wanted me to tell you that hes placed a large bet on you
This is what its all about Please I beg you No my lord Im comfortable like this thank you
Sir your description of him doesnt detract from his good qualities though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin and even so you wouldnt be able to keep up with him
I felt like skipping school sir
I wouldnt allow your enemies to say that and I wont believe it from you
I know youd never skip school
What are you doing here in Elsinore
Ill teach you to drink hard by the time you leave
Sir we came to see your fathers funeral
Please dont make fun of me
I think you came to see my mothers wedding instead
Well sir its true it came soon after
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet
Oh Id rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven Horatio than have lived through that terrible day
My fatherI think I see my father
Where sir
In my imagination Horatio
I saw him once
He was an admirable king
He was a great human being
He was perfect in everything
Ill never see the likes of him again
You speak absolutely correctly sir
And whats the point sir
Why are we talking about him like this
Sorry sir
I know you know something Thanks for the compliment Im happy you know that
But in fact it doesnt say much
Im sorry you were saying
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is
I cant admit that since youd have to compare his excellence to mine
Excellent in fencing I mean sir
The rapier and the dagger
Those are only two of his weapons
But go on
The king has bet six Barbary horses and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed and they match the fencing accessories
What do you mean by carriages
The carriages sir are the hangerswhere the swords hang
Carriage makes it sound like its pulling around a cannon
I prefer to call it a hanger But anyway
Six Barbary horses six French swords with accessories and three imaginatively designed carriagessounds like a French bet against the Danish
Why has all this been put on the table
The king sir has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes he wont beat you by more than three hits
But what if my answers no
Its my exercise time
My services are at your command
Thank you
Its a good thing hes here to recommend himself
No one else would
He used to praise his mothers nipple before he sucked it
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away or wait awhile
Ill do whatever the king wants
If hes ready now so am I
Otherwise Ill do it anytime as long as Im able
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else
Right on cue
The queen wants you to chat with Laertespolitelybefore you begin your match
Shes full of good advice
Youre going to lose this bet my lord
I dont think so
Ive been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France
With the handicap theyve given me I think Ill win
But I have a sinking feeling anyway
Oh well
Ill say youre not feeling well
Youll do no such thing
I thumb my nose at superstitions
Whats important is to be prepared
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind then what does it mean to leave early
Let it be
Come shake hands with Laertes Hamlet
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so
Yes hand me one too
Im going to make you look sharp Laertes
Youre making fun of me
No I swear Im not
Yes my lord quite well
Youve bet on the weaker fencer
Ive seen both of you fence
But since Laertes is better weve given him a handicap
Yes my lord
Put the goblets of wine on that table
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit then let my soldiers give him a military salute
Ill drink to Hamlets health and into his goblet Ill drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings
Give me the goblets
Come on sir
Come on my lord
That was one hit
No it wasnt
Referee
It was obviously a hit
Well lets go on
Give me a gobletHamlet this pearls yours
Heres to your health
Give him the goblet
Set it down awhile
Lets play
Another hit
What do you say
You got me I admit it
My son will win
Hes flabby and out of breathHere Hamlet take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness Hamlet 
Thank you madam
Gertrude dont drink that
Excuse me
Ill drink it if I like
Id better not drink now
Ill drink later
Come on let me wipe your face
I doubt it
Get ready for the third hit Laertes
Youre just playing around
Come on give me your best shot
I sense youre treating me like a child
You think so
Come on
Take this
Separate them
Theyre overdoing it
No come on one more time
Take care of the queen
Both fencers are bleedinghow do you feel my lord
How do you feel Laertes
Like a mouse caught in my own trap Osric
Hows the queen
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding
The drink the drink
Ive been poisoned
Oh what evil
Lock the door
Weve been betrayed
Find out who did it
Im the one Hamlet
Hamlet youre dead
No medicine in the world can cure you
You dont have more than half an hour to live
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand sharp and dipped in poison
The foul plan backfired on me
Here I lie and will never get up again
Your mothers been poisoned
I cant speak anymore
The king the kings to blame
Then get to work poison
Sir I think I saw him last night
Saw who
The king my father
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw with these gentlemen as witnesses
For Gods sake let me hear it
After midnight for two nights running these two guards Marcellus and Barnardo saw a figure that looked very much like your father in full armor from head to toe
It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times a staffs distance from their amazed eyes while they turned quaking with fear and too shocked to speak
I knew your father
But where did this happen
Treason
Treason
Protect me my friends
Ive only been hurt not killed
Here you goddamn incestbreeding Danish murderer drink this
Is your little pearl in there
Follow my mother
He got what he deserved
He mixed that poison himself
Please forgive me as I forgive you Hamlet
Youre not responsible for my death and my fathers and Im not responsible for yours
God will free you from blame
Youre alive
Not for a second
Im more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane
Some of this liquors still left in the goblet 
Please give me that goblet if you love me
Let go of it
Ill get it from you I swear
Oh God Horatio what a damaged reputation Im leaving behind me as no one knows the truth
If you ever loved me then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story
What are these warlike noises
Young Fortinbras returning in triumph from Poland is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors
Oh Im dying Horatio
This strong poisons overpowering me
I will not live to hear the news from England
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown
Hes got my vote as I die
Oh oh oh oh
What do I see here
What would you like to see
These corpses suggest mayhem
Oh proud Death what banquet are you preparing that youve needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke
This is a horrible sight
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
Who will thank us now
As for me I welcome my good luck with sadness
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities
Pick up the corpses
On the platform where we stand guard sir
Didnt you talk to it
I did sir but it didnt answer me
Thats very strange
I swear to God its true sir
We thought you ought to know about it
Yes I should know but it disturbs me
Are you on duty again tonight
Yes sir
It was armed you say
Armed sir
From head to toe
Yes from top to bottom sir
So you couldnt see his face then
Oh yes we could sir
He had his helmet visor up
Was he pale or flushed and redfaced
Very pale sir
Did he stare at you
The whole time
I wish Id been there
Did it stay a long time
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred
No longer than that
Not the time I saw it
His beard was gray right
It was just like in real life dark brown with silver whiskers in it
Ill stand guard with you tonight
Maybe itll come again
I bet it will
If it looks like my good father Ill speak to it even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet
I ask you if youve kept this a secret keep doing so
Whatever happens tonight dont talk about it
Ill return the favor
So goodbye for now
Ill see you on the guards platform between eleven and twelve tonight
Well do our duty to you sir
Give me your love instead as I give you mine
Goodbye
My fathers ghostarmed
Somethings wrong
I suspect some foul play
I wish the night were here already
Until then I have to remain calm
Bad deeds will be revealed no matter how people try to hide them
My belongings are on the ship already
Goodbye
And my dear sister as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing let me hear from youwrite
Do you doubt Ill write
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you just consider it a big flirtation the temporary phase of a hotblooded youth
It wont last
Not a second more
No more than a minute
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands
Watch out Ophelia
Just keep your love under control and dont let yourself become a target of his lust
Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease
So be careful
Fear will keep you safe
Young people often lose their selfcontrol even without any help from others
Ill keep your words of wisdom close to my heart
Dont worry I wont
Ive been here too long
And here comes father
Youre still here
Shame on youget on board
The wind is filling your ships sail and theyre waiting for you
Here I give you my blessing again
And just try to remember a few rules of life
Dont say what youre thinking and dont be too quick to act on what you think
Be friendly to people but dont overdo it
Dont be quick to pick a fight but once youre in one hold your own
Listen to many people but talk to few
Hear everyones opinion but reserve your judgment
Goodbye son
Your servants are waiting
Its locked away in my memory and youve got the key
Goodbye
What did he tell you Ophelia
Something about Hamlet
If things are the way people tell me they areand theyre only telling me this to warn methen I have to say youre not conducting yourself with the selfrestraint a daughter of mine should show
Whats going on between you two
Tell me the truth
Hes offered me a lot of affection lately
Affection Thats nothing
Youre talking like some innocent girl who doesnt understand the ways of the world
Do you believe his offers as you call them
I dont know what to believe father
Then Ill tell you
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these offers are something real
Offer yourself more respect ornot to beat this word to deathyoull offer me the chance to be a laughingstock
Go on
And hes made the holiest vows to me to back up what he says
These vows are just traps for stupid birds
I know when a man is on fire hell swear anything
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do
Do as I say
Now come along
Ill do as you say father
Friends of this country
And servants of the Danish king
Good night to you both
Goodbye
Whos taken over the watch for you
Barnardos taken my place
Good night
Is Horatio here too
More or less
So tell us did you see that thing again tonight
I havent seen anything
Horatio says were imagining it and wont let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that weve seen twice now
Thats why Ive begged him to come on our shift tonight so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it
Yes its definitely nippy
What time is it
A little before twelve I think
No its just after twelve I heard the clock strike
Really
I didnt hear it
So its nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear
What does that mean sir
Is that a tradition
Yes it is
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements as great as they are and lessens our reputations
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations
Look sirhere it comes
Oh angels protect us
Whether youre a good spirit or a cursed demon whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire whether your intentions are good or evil you look so strange I want to talk to you
Ill call you Hamlet Senior King Father royal Dane Answer me
Dont drive me crazy with curiosity but tell me why your churchburied bones have burst out of their coffin and why your tomb
where we quietly buried you has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again
Why
It wants you to go off with it as if it wants to tell you something alone
Look how politely its pointing you to a place thats farther away
But dont go
Definitely not
Dont do it sir
Why whats the danger
And as for my soul how can the ghost endanger that since its as immortal as the ghost is
Look its waving me over again
Ill follow it
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane
Think about it
Its still waving to me
Youre not going sir
Let go of me
Calm down
Youre not going anywhere
Let me go gentlemen
I swear if anyone holds me back Ill make a ghost of him
His imagination is making him crazy
Lets follow them
Its not right to obey his orders to let him go alone
No lets follow him
Where are you taking me
Speak
Listen to me
I will
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory
Ah poor ghost
Speak
Im ready to hear you
You must be ready for revenge too when you hear me out
What
Im the ghost of your father doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night while during the day Im trapped in the fires of purgatory until Ive done penance for my past sins
If I werent forbidden to tell you the secrets of 
make your eyes jump out of their sockets and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills
But mortals like you arent allowed to hear this description of the afterlife
Listen listen
If you ever loved your poor dear father Oh God
Take revenge for his horrible murder that crime against nature
Murder
His most horrible murder
Murders always horrible but this one was especially horrible weird and unnatural
Youd have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of  I knew it
My uncle
Oh Hamlet how far she fell
She went from me who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine
So let me be brief here
And thats how my brother robbed me of my life my crown and my queen all at once
Oh its horrible horrible so horrible
If you are human dont stand for it
Dont let the Danish kings bed be a nest of incest
Leave her to God and her own guilt
Now goodbye
The glowworms light is beginning to fade so morning is near
Goodbye goodbye goodbye
Remember me
Ah all you up in heaven
And earth
What else
Shall I include hell as well
Damn it
Keep beating my heart and muscles dont grow old yetkeep me standing
Remember you
Yes you poor ghost as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head
Remember you
Yes Ill wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there
Yes by God
Oh you evil woman
Oh you villain villain you damned smiling villain
Wheres my notebookIts a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile and be a villain
At least its possible in Denmark 
He said Remember me I swore I would
Sir sir
Lord Hamlet Please let him be all right
Im all right
Ohhoho sir
Ohhoho kid
Come here
So how did it go sir
What happened sir
It was incredible
Oh please tell us sir
I swear I wont sir
I wont either sir
Okay
But you promise you can keep a secret
Yes I swear
Sit down for a while and well tell you again the story you dont want to believe about what weve seen two nights now
Well lets sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us
Last night when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where its shining now at one oclock Marcellus and I Quiet shut up
Its come again
Looking just like the dead king
Very much so
Its terrifying
It wants us to speak to it
Ask it something Horatio
By God I order you to speak
Any villain in Denmark is going to be well a villain
You dont need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that sir
Yes youre absolutely right
So without further ado the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways
You go and take care of your business since everybody has some business to take care of whatever it is worth and Ill go and pray
Youre talking in such a crazy way sir
No offense taken
Ah but there is Horatio theres a lot of offense
As for this ghost we just saw hes a real one I can tell you that much
But regarding what happened between us dont askI cant tell you
And now my friends my courageous and educated friends do me one small favor
What is it sir
Of course we will
Dont ever tell anyone what youve seen tonight
We wont sir
No you have to swear it
I swear to God I wont
Me too I wont I swear to God
Swear by my sword
But we already swore sir
Yes but swear by my sword this time
Agree to swear
You swear never to mention what youve seen
Swear by my sword
Come over here gentlemen and put your hands on my sword again
Swear by my sword youll never mention what youve heard
You said it right old mole
What a tunneler
Lets move again my friends
My God this is unbelievably strange
Then give it a nice welcome as you would give to any stranger
There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio than youve even dreamed of
Swear you wont
Lets go back to court together but 
Give him this money and these letters Reynaldo
I will sir
It would be wonderfully wise of you my dear Reynaldo to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him
Thats what I thought too sir
Excellent very good
Do you get what Im saying Reynaldo
Yes very well sir
You should say I sort of know him but not well
Isnt he the one whos always and so on
Like gambling sir
Thats right or drinking swearing fistfighting visiting prostitutesthat kind of thing
But that would ruin his reputation
Oh no not if you say it right
But sir Why should you do this you want to know
Yes sir
Id like to know
Yes sir
And then hell … hell … wait what was I about to say
Good God I was about to say something
What was I saying
I just saw him yesterday or the other day or whenever it is you know and there he was gambling or there he was totally wasted or fighting with somebody about a tennis match or going into a house of ill reputethat means a whorehouse you knowor whatever
You get my point dont you
Yes I do sir
God bless you
Have a safe trip
Thank you sir
I will sir
And I hope hes studying his music like hes supposed to
Got it sir
Goodbye
From what in Gods name
Is he crazy with love for you
What did he say
He stayed like that a long time
Finally after shaking my arm a little and jerking his head up and down three times he sighed like it was his last breath
Come with me
Ill go tell the king about this
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people selfdestruct as much as any strong emotion
Im so sorry
Thats what made him crazy
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation
Damn my suspicious thoughts
Its as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy
Come on lets go see the king
Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Ive wanted to see you for a long time now but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away
Youve probably heard about the change thats come over Hamletthats the only word for it since inside and out hes different from what he was before
I cant imagine whats made him so unlike himself other than his fathers death
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command instead of asking us so politely
But well obey
Thanks Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern
Thanks Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son whos changed too much
Servants take these gentlemen to see Hamlet
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good
Amen to that
The ambassadors are back from Norway sir
Once again you bring good news
Do I sir
I assure your majesty Im only doing my duty both to my God and my good king 
It looks like youve offended it
Look its going away
Stay
I order you speak
Whats going on Horatio
Youre pale and trembling
You agree now that were not imagining this dont you
What do you think about it
I swear to God if I hadnt seen this with my own eyes Id never believe it
Doesnt it look like the king
Yes as much as you look like yourself
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles traveling on the ice in sleds
Its weird
And I believeunless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to bethat Ive found out why Hamlets gone crazy
Tell me
I want very much to find out
All right but first let the ambassadors speak
Then you can hear my news as dessert
Then be so kind as to show them in
Gertrude he says hes found out the reason for your sons insanity
I doubt its anything but the obvious reason his fathers dying and our quick marriage
Welcome my good friends
Tell me Voltemand whats the news from the king of Norway
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him and he ordered Fortinbrass arrest
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand  I like this news and when I have time Ill read this and think about how to reply
Meanwhile thank you for your efforts
Go relax now
Tonight well have dinner
Welcome back
Well that turned out well in the end
Sir and madam to make grand speeches about what majesty is what service is or why day is day night is night and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day night and time
Your son is crazy
Crazy Im calling it since how can you say what craziness is except to say that its craziness
But thats another story
Think about it
I have a daughter I have her until she gets married whos given me this letter considering it her duty
Madam please be patient
Ill read it to you
Oh Ophelia Im bad at poetry
I cant put my feelings into verse but please believe I love you best oh best of all
Believe it
Hamlet Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter and more like it
And how did she react to all this
Sir what is your opinion of me
I know you are loyal and honorable
I would like to prove to you that I am
No I had to do something
And so I said to my daughter Lord Hamlet is a prince hes out of your league
It may be it certainly may be
Has there ever been a timeId really like to knowwhen Ive definitely said something was true and it turned out not to be true
Not that I know of
What can we do to find out if its true
Well you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time
Yes he does
When hes there next time Ill send my daughter to see him
Please go away both of you
Ill speak to him now
Oh please let me
How are you Hamlet
Fine thank you
Do you know who I am
The town is besieged and the trumpet calls us to the gap and we talk and do nothing by Christ
Its a disgrace to us all
I swear by the mass before I close my eyes to go to sleep Ill put in some good fighting or Ill lie in the ground dead
Captain Macmorris I think seecorrect me if Im wrongthere are not many of your nation My nation
What is my nation
Its a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal
What is my nation
Who talks of my nation
Captain Macmorris if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant see Ill have to think youre not treating me with the good will you ought to see since I am as good a man as yourself both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself
So by Christ Ill cut off your head
Now now both of you gentlemen
Yes and thats a serious failing
The town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation
Captain Macmorris when we have more leisure see I will be so bold as to show you I know about the practice of warfare and thats that
What has the governor of the town decided
This is the final discussion I will grant
So submit to my mercy or like men who revel in their own destruction challenge me to do my worst
For as I am a soldier the name I think suits me best once I begin my attack on Harfleur again I will not leave the halfconquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes
The gates of mercy will be closed by then and harsh and hardhearted soldiers who have tasted blood will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants
What power can rein in promiscuous evil once its gotten rolling
We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting
What do you say
Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town
Today our hopes are at an end
The Dauphin whom we asked for reinforcements sends back the answer that hes not yet in a position to raise so great an army
Therefore great king we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy
Open your gates
Come uncle Exeter enter Harfleur
Stay there and fortify it well against the French
Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest tomorrow well march on
No Ill recite it for you right now de hand de fangres de nails De nails madame
Ugh
Thats enough for one lesson
Hes certainly crossed the river Somme
And if he advances unopposed my lord let us abandon France
Let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation
God alive
If they march along unopposed I will sell my dukedom for a sodden filthy farm in that craggy isle of Albion
Doesnt the sun shine palely down on them as though in contempt killing their fruit with frowns
And shall our lively blood quickened by wine be so frosty
Where is Montjoy the herald
Send him on his way quickly
Tell him to greet the king of England with our sharp defiance
Rise princes and with a spirit of honor more sharply edged than your swords rush to the battlefield Charles Delabreth High Constable of France you dukes of Orléans Bourbon Berri Alençon Brabant Bar and Burgundy Jaques Chatillon Rambures Vaudemont Beaumont Grandpré Roussi and Fauconberg Foix Lestrale Bouciqualt and Charolois
Stop Harry of England who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur
Have Montjoy hurry then Lord Constable and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war
Prince Dauphin youll stay with me in Rouen
No please I beg your Majesty
Be patient because youre staying with me
Go now Lord Constable and all you princes and quickly bring us news of Englands defeat
Is the duke of Exeter safe
He is called Ensign Pistol
I dont know him
Here he is
Captain I have a favor to beg of you
Youre on very good terms with the duke of Exeter
Yes God be praised I have managed to earn his favor
She provides an excellent moral
Im glad to hear it
Discipline must be kept
Then die and be damned
Why that man is a total fraud and rascal
What he just said to meits alright
And what a beard trimmed like the generals or a rough uniform will do among foaming mugs and brains washed with ale you wouldnt believe
But you must learn to recognize such liars or you will be greatly taken advantage of
If I find an opportunity I will give him a piece of my mind
Tell me Fluellen did you just come from the bridge
Yes your Majesty
The duke of Exeter has held the bridge very gallantly
The French have retreated see and there were great acts of courage
Indeed the enemy nearly took the bridge but he was forced to retreat and the duke of Exeter holds the bridge
I can tell your Majesty the duke is a brave man
What men have you lost Fluellen
The enemys losses have been very great pretty substantial
To tell the truth though I think the duke hasnt lost a single man except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church one BardolphI dont know if your Majesty knows the man
I want all such offenders to be dealt with that way and I give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages nothing taken that is not paid for none of the French harassed or abused in disrespectful language
You know from my clothing who I am
Well then I know who you are
What do you have to tell me
My masters decision
Go ahead
My king says this Tell Harry of England though we appeared dead we were only asleep
Strategy makes a better soldier than haste
Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened
Now the time is right for us to speak and we do so with imperial authority
Favorably except that there wasnt enough time for his Grace to hear as I sensed he would have liked to the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in France and to the throne of France in general through clear lines of descent originating with his greatgrandfather Edward III
What kept you from telling him this
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king
And in fact I think theyre meeting together right now
Is it four oclock
It is
Then lets go in and hear what he has to saythough I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word
have lost and the indignity we have endured for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back
His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood weve shed and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with
Add defiance to all this and by way of conclusion tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him whose death sentence has been pronounced My king and masters message delivered my task is done
What is your name
I know your position
Montjoy
You do your job well
Go back and tell your king I do not seek an encounter with him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without interference forto be honest though its probably unwise to confess this to a powerful enemy who has the advantagemy men are considerably weakened by illness my numbers reduced and those few men I have almost no better than so many Frenchmen though when they were in good form I tell you herald I thought three Frenchmen walked on every pair of English legs
But God forgive me for bragging
Anyway go tell your master I am here
Ill deliver the message
I thank your Highness
I hope they dont attack us now
Were in Gods hands brother not in theirs
March to the bridge
Night is approaching
I have the best armor in the world
I wish it were day
You have wonderful armor but give my horse his due
It is the best horse in Europe
Will it never be morning
My lord of Orléans and my lord high Constable are you talking about horses and armor
You are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world
What a long night this is
I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs
He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs
The earth sings when he touches it
The lowest part of his hoof is more musical than Pans pipe
Hes the color of nutmeg
And hot as ginger
He is an animal worthy of Perseus
He is indeed worthy of the name horse and you can call all the rest beasts
Indeed my lord he is a perfectly wonderful horse
He is the prince of horses
His neigh is like a monarchs command
Enough cousin
No the man who cannot extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever
Its a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea
If each grain of sand had a tongue to eulogize my horse would be a topic for them all
He is a subject for a king to contemplate and for a kings king to ride on and for the world at largeboth friend and strangerto stop whatever they are doing and marvel at
I once wrote a sonnet in his praise which began Wonder of nature I have heard a sonnet to ones mistress that began like that
Then the writer imitated the one I composed to my steed for my horse is my mistress
Your mistress is a good mount
So perhaps did yours
Mine wasnt wearing a bridle
Oh then I guess she was old and gentle and you rode barelegged like an Irish yokel
Youre a good judge of horsemanship
Take a tip from me then
Id rather have my horse than a mistress
Id prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse
Ill tell you this Constable my mistress has his own hair
I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress
The dog returns to its own vomit and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle Youd take anything for a mistress
At least I dont have a horse for my mistressor a saying so beside the point
My Lord Constable are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight
Stars my lord
I hope some will fall off tomorrow
And yet Ill still have plenty
No doubt for you wear too many in the first place and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer
Yes like your horse who staggering under your boasts would trot more easily if some of them dismounted
I only wish I could load him up with all the praise he deserves
Oh will it never be day
Id say the same thing but Im afraid Id be faced out of my way
Its midnight
Ill go put my armor on
The Dauphin really wants it to be morning
He wants to eat the English
Swear by her foot so she can stamp out the oath
Hes definitely the most active gentleman of France
Performing is activity and he is always doing that
He never did harm that I heard of
And hes not going to do any tomorrow
That part of his reputation will stand
I know him to be valiant
I was told that by one who knows him better than you
Who was that
Why he told me so himself and he said he didnt care who knew it
He doesnt have to care
His virtue is not hidden
His courage is hidden and when it is revealed it will shrink
Ill will never prompted anything well said
Ill go straight for that proverb with To hell with the devil You are better at proverbs than I am by as much as A fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark You have overshot
Ive outshot you and not for the first time
My Lord High Constable the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents
Who measured the ground
The Lord Grandpré
Poor Harry of England
He doesnt long for the dawn as we do
What a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of England is to blunder with his fatheaded followers so far beyond his capacity
If the English had any sense they would run away
If there were anything inside their heads they could never wear such heavy helmets
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures
Their hounds are unequaled in courage
Foolish dogs blindly running straight toward a Russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples
You might just as well say Thats a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion Yes exactly
And the men resemble their English hounds in their loud showy ferocity too leaving their brains behind with their wives
Give them hefty meals of beef and iron and steel and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils
Yes but these English are seriously short of beef
Then tomorrow well find that they feel only like eating not like fighting
Its time to put our armor on
Shall we get started
Its two oclock now
But let me see by ten we shall each have captured a hundred Englishmen
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe
He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury
Hes not here
Send for him dear uncle
Shall we call in the ambassador my liege
Not yet cousin
Before I hear him I want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and France
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time
Thank you Im sure
My learned lord kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldnt bar me in my claim
For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do
them brothers friends and countrymen
There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression nor has the long sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color
Gloucester its true that we are in great danger
But our courage should only be the greater for that
Good morning brother Bedford
God Almighty there must be some essential goodness even in evil if men would only look for it
In our case our bad neighbors over their make us early risers a healthy and sensible thing to be
Besides they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death
Think like that and youll manage to get honey out of a common weed and find a moral lesson in the devil himself
Good morning old Sir Thomas Erpingham
A nice soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than Frances hard cold ground
It eases the spirit
And when the mind is engaged the rest of the body dead and dull before wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity like a snake shedding its dead skin
Lend me your cloak Sir Thomas
We shall my liege
Shall I accompany your Grace
No my good knight
Go with my brothers to my English peers
I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and dont want any company
The Lord in heaven bless you noble Harry
A friend
Or are you low vulgar and of the common people
I am a gentleman of a company
Do you carry a pike
Exactly
What about you
Im as good a gentleman as the emperor
Then youre a better man than the king
The kings a dear boy with a heart of gold hes a lively lad a wag born of fine parents good with his fists
I kiss his dirty shoe and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy
What is your name
Harry le Roy
Le Roy
Thats a Cornish name
Are you with a Cornish company
No I am a Welshman
Do you know Fluellen
Yes
Tell him Ill take the leek out of his hat on Saint Davys Day and slap his head with it
Youd better not wear your dagger in your cap that day or he might slap your head with it
Are you his friend
Yes and his relative too
Thank you
God be with you
My name is Pistol
The name suits your fierceness
Captain Fluellen
It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct traditional principles and rules of war
If you would take the trouble to study the tactics of Pompey the Great I can tell you that you would find no tittletattle or pibblepabble in Pompeys camp
I tell you you would find the rituals of war and I promise you its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise
But the enemy is loud
You can hear them all night long
And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot does that mean you think that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot
Think about it
I will lower my voice
Though he seems a little oldfashioned there is much care and courage in this Welshman
Brother John Bates isnt that dawn breaking over there
Thats the beginning of the day we see but I dont think well see the end of itWho goes there
A friend
What captain do you serve
Sir Thomas Erpingham
A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman
Tell me what does he think of our situation
Were men beached on the sand hoping to be washed out by the next tide
He hasnt told this to the king has he
The violet smells to him the same as it does to me
And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours when they plummet they plummet that much farther
Therefore when he has reason to fear as we do his fears are without question of the same order
Still it stands to reason that he mustnt betray his fear as it might dishearten his army
He can act as brave as he wants but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neckdeep in the Thames and I wish he were too and I with him whatever the danger so long as we were far away from here
Ill tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart
I dont think he wants to be anywhere but where he is
Oh Im sure you dont dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel
I dont think theres anywhere Id rather die than in the kings company as his cause is just and honorable
Thats more than we know
If his cause is wrong our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it
But if the cause is not just the king himself will have a lot to answer for when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together on Judgment Day crying We died at such and such a place Some will be swearing some crying for a surgeon some for the wives that are destitute without them some about the debts they owed some for their children left unprovided for
I think few die well who die in battle
The father and the master and the king didnt order their subordinates deaths when they ordered their services
Besides theres no king however pure his cause who if it comes to a trial by combat can rely on using completely blameless soldiers
Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home they cannot escape God
When they feared death they escaped with their lives and now where they imagine theyre safe they perish
So if they die unprepared the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes theyre finally being punished for
Every subjects duty is the kings but every subjects soul is his own
Therefore every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do clear his conscience of any stain
Then if he dies his death serves him
Its clear every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death
The king is not responsible for it
I dont expect him to answer for me and yet Im determined to fight vigorously for him
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed
If I live to see it Ill never trust his word again
Yeah right go get him
Thats a lame threat from a toy gun a poor individuals private displeasure with a monarch
You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather
Youll never trust his word again Come on that was a stupid thing to say
Your scolding is somewhat overblown
Id be angry with you if the occasion allowed
Let it be a quarrel between us if you live
Im game
How will I recognize you in the future
Give me some trinket of yours and I will wear it in my hat
Then if you dare to acknowledge it Ill take up my quarrel with you
Here
Ill also wear this in my cap
If you come to me after tomorrow and say Thats my glove I swear by this hand I will take it and give you a box on the ear
If I ever see it I will challenge you
You may as well undertake to be hanged
Ill do it even if I find you in the company of the king himself
Keep your word
Farewell
Indeed the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that theyll beat us they have such an army
But its no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crowna head I meanand tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping
to wage war
I charge you in the name of God be careful what you say
With this in mind speak my lord
Then hear me gracious sovereign and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne
Upon the king
Lets lay everything upon the king our lives our souls our debts our anxious wives our children and our sins I must bear responsibility for all of it
What a painful condition responsibility is
It goes along with being born to greatness but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about
What infinite peace do kings give up that private men enjoy
What do kings have that private men do not besides the pomp of their position
And what is this useless ceremony of kings
What kind of god is ceremony which suffers more than its worshippers do
What income what profit does it bring in
Oh ceremony only show me your value
Why are you adored
Youre less happy being feared than they are in fearing you
What do you get to drink instead of sweet obedience but poisonous flattery
Try being sick great greatness and see if ceremony can cure you
Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles
Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping
You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee but can you take possession of his health
No vain illusion so intricately bound up with a kings rest
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace
My lord your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp
Good old knight gather them all together at my tent
Ill meet you there
Consider it done my lord
Oh God of battles bolster my soldiers courage
Dont let them know fear
Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage
And just for today Oh Lord just today dont think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown
Ive transferred Richards body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood
Ive hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year
And Ive built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for Richards soul
I will do more though nothing I can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime asking for pardon
My liege
My brother Gloucesters voice
Ill go with you
The day my friends and everything await me
The sun glints off our armor
Awake my lords
Is it time my Lord Constable
Listen to our horses neighing longing to be working
Ha
What you want them to weep our horses blood
Then how will we see their own natural tears
The English are in the field French lords
To our horses you gallant princes
Whats there to say
Our advance will so dazzle the enemy that England will cower in fear and surrender
What are you waiting for lords of France
Those islandbred skeletons terrified for their bones are an offensive sight on the morning field
The horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks torches in their hands
Meanwhile their  Theyve said their prayers and now they wait for death
Shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them
To the field
Ill take the banner from a trumpeter and use that
Come lets be off
The sun is up and were wasting the day
Where is the king
The king rode out alone to view their troops
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men
Thats five to one
Besides theyre fresh
May Gods arm strike on our side
These are frightening odds
God be with all of you princes
Ill go and join my men
Farewell good Salisbury and may good luck go with you
Farewell kind lord
Fight valiantly today
But then I do you wrong to say as much since you are the very embodiment of bravery
He is as full of courage as of kindness princely in both
Oh if only we had with us here ten thousand of those men back home in England who arent working today
Who wishes that
My cousin Westmoreland
No my dear cousin
If we are slated to die the fewer the better for our country and if were slated to live the fewer men the greater the share of honor for each of us
In Gods name I beg you not to wish for one more man
By God I am not selfish when it comes to money I dont care who eats at my expense
But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor I am the most guilty soul alive
No my cousin dont wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead
By God I wouldnt lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me I thinknot even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory
Oh do not wish one more
He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home
We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us
He who survives this day and lives to see old age shall yearly entertain his neighbors on the eve saying Tomorrow is 
Were ready if our minds are ready
Let any man perish who isnt ready now
You dont wish we had more help from England anymore cousin
God be with you all
Once more I come to ask you King Harry if youre ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat
For assuredly you are so near the abyss that youre bound to be swallowed up
Moreover out of mercy the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where poor wretches their bodies will likely fall and fester
Who sent you this time
The Constable of France
Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before
Tell them to capture me then sell my bones
The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him
And on their graves I trust the story of this days work will be written in brass
And those who leave their valiant bones in France dying like men though buried in your dunghillstheyll be remembered too
Besides according to the French historians King Pepin who deposed Childeric based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild the daughter of King Clothair
Another case Hugh Capet who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorrainesole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Greatpassed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare daughter of Charlemagne who was the son of Lewis the Emperor who was the son of Charles the Great in order to give his claim to the throne more validity though in fact the claim was completely false and worthless
Another case King Lewis the Tenth who was sole heir to the usurper Capet could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel his grandmother was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France
Thus it should be clear as day that King Pepins title Hugh Capets claim and the resolution of King Lewiss doubts all plainly derive from the female
Let me speak proudly tell the Constable were only workaday soldiers
Theres not a strand of feather left in our whole armya good sign I hope that we wont fly away like birdsand time on the field has made us slovenly
If they do this as they will God willing my ransom will soon be raised
Herald spare yourself
Dont come again to ask for my ransom good messenger
I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine
Tell the constable that
I shall King Harry
And so farewell
Youll never hear from the herald again
Im afraid youll come to me again for ransom
My lord most humbly on bended knee I beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard
Take it brave York
Now soldiers advance
Surrender dog
Is that a lot of      He says his name is Master Fer
Master Fer
What does he say
He begs you to spare his life
He is a gentleman of a good family and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns
Tell him my fury will abate and Ill take the crowns
Explain boy
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one as he thinks who is the bravest most valorous and thriceworthy gentleman of England
As I get to leech him I will show some mercy
Follow me
I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart
I have to stay with the servants who are with our camps luggage
Were sitting ducks for the French if they only knew it for there is no one guarding it but boys
Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets mocking us
Do not run away
Our men have all broken ranks
O everlasting shame
Lets fall on our swords
Are these the wretches that we threw dice for
Is this the king we offered to ransom
Shame eternal shame and nothing but shame
Let us die honorably
He who will not follow me now let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp cap in hand while some slave no nobler than my dog violates his daughter
Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us
Lets go offer up our lives 
There are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order
The hell with order
Im going back into battle
Let life be short so that shame wont last too long
The French are still fighting
The duke of York sends your Majesty his respects
Is he still alive good uncle
Three times in an hour I saw him down and three times up again and fighting
He was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs
By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk Yorks comrade and equal in brave wounds
Suffolk died first and York cut to pieces came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face kissing his gashes
He cried out Wait for me dear cousin
My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven
Wait for mine sweet soul
The French have reinforced their scattered men
Then every soldier must kill his prisoners
Spread the word
To this day the kings of France follow this unspoken rule even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim
For it is written in the book of Numbers When the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter Gracious lord claim what is yours
Go to the tomb of your greatgrandfather from whom your own title to the crown derives
Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince your greatuncle who fought a tragic battle on French soil routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen
O noble English who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces leaving the other half to stand by idle and laughing
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again
You are their heir and sit on their throne and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins
To kill the boys with the luggage
Its expressly against the rules of combat
Its as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up
Theres certainly not a boy left alive and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle
On top of this theyve either burned or carried away everything that was in the kings tent
Oh hes a gallant king
Yes he was born at Monmouth Captain Gower
And is pig not the same as great may I ask
The pig or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimousthey all mean the same thing with some variation
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon
His father was Philip of Macedon as I remember
I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born
I tell you Captain if you look at a map of the world Ill bet you will find comparing Macedon and Monmouth that the situations see are very similar
There is a river in Macedon and there is likewise a river in Monmouth
The river in Monmouth is called Wye but the name of the other river has gone out of my head
Nevertheless its all onethe two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers and there are salmon in both
If you look closely at Alexanders life Harry of Monmouths stands up fairly well by comparisonfor there are analogies in everything
Alexander God knows and you know in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations and also being a little the worse for drink killed his best friend Cleitus in a drunken rage see
It is not courteous you know to assume you know my meaning before Ive finished talking
Im speaking purely in analogies and comparisons
Sir John Falstaff
Thats the one
I tell you there are good men born at Monmouth
Here comes his Majesty
I was not angry since I came to France until this instant
Take a trumpet herald
Ride out to the horsemen on that hill
If they seek battle with us have them come down or else clear the field
The sight of them is offensive
If theyll do neither well come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings
Go and tell them this
Here comes the herald of the French my liege
He looks humbler than he used to
Dont you know that I have offered these bones of mine for ransom
Are you coming again for ransom
No great king
I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them separating our nobles from the common men for many of our princesalaslie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers
Likewise our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes and their wounded steeds ankledeep in gore struggle and raging wildly stamp on their dead masters with their hooves killing them a second time
Oh give us permission great king to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies
You won it
God not our strength be praised
What is the name of the castle that stands over there
Agincourt
Then well call this the Battle of Agincourt fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus
If I may say so your Majesty your famous grandfather and your greatuncle Edward the Black Prince of Walesor so Ive read in the history booksfought a very brave battle here in France
They did Fluellen
Your Majesty is quite right
If your Majesties recall it the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which your Majesty knows is to this day a badge of honorable military service
I do believe your Majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on Saint Davys Day
I wear it with pride for I am Welsh you know good countryman
Thanks my good countryman
By Jesus I am your Majestys countryman and I dont care who knows it
I will confess it to all the world
I neednt be ashamed of your Majesty God be praised so long as your Majesty is an honest man
God keep me soHeralds go with him
Bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides
Soldier you must come to the king
Soldier why are you wearing that glove in your cap
If it pleases your Majesty it is the token of a man I must fight with if hes still alive
An Englishman
If I may say so your Majesty as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to
It may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree quite outside of his own sphere
Even if he were as important a man as the devilas Lucifer or Beelzebub himselfhes required see your Grace to keep his vow
If he backs down hell become as notorious a villain and as saucy a Jack as ever walked on Gods earth in my opinion
Then keep your vow fellow when you meet the man
So I will my liege
Whom do you serve under
Under Captain Gower my liege
Gower is a good captain and is well versed and well read in the wars
Have him come to me here soldier
I will my liege
Here Fluellen stick this in your cap
Your Grace does me as great an honor as could be wished by any of his subjects
Do you know Captain Gower
He is my dear friend your Majesty
Go find him please and bring him to my tent
Ill fetch him
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester follow Fluellen at a close distance
The glove which I have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear
According to an agreement I should wear it myself
Follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them
You come with me uncle of Exeter
Im sure it is to knight you Captain
As it is Gods will and pleasure Captain I entreat you to come quickly to the king
Sir do you recognize this glove
Know the glove
I know the glove is a glove
Well I recognize this one  Good God
As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire worldor even France or England
Do you think Id break my oath
Stand aside Captain Gower
Ill reward treason with blows I promise you
Im not a traitor
Arrest him hes a friend of the duke of Alençons
My Lord of Warwick a most corrupt treasonGod be praised for ithas been discovered as plain as any youd hope to see on a summers day
Here is his Majesty
My liege this man is a villain and a traitor whosee your Gracehas struck the glove which your Majesty took from Alençons helmet
My liege this was my glove
I met this man with my glove in his cap and I have been as good as my word
Your Majesty see hereif it wont offend your Gracewhat a complete rascally beggarly lousy rat this is
I hope your Majesty will in all good conscience bear me out and vouch for the fact that this is the glove of Alençon and that your Majesty gave it to me
It was I in fact whom you promised to strike
And so you do
Their bodies may remain here in England but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already
Oh let their bodies follow my dear king to win back whats rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire
What we have to worry about is a fullscale invasion from Scotlandalways an unreliable neighbor
If it pleases your Majesty let his neck pay the price if there is any martial law in the world
How can you square things with me
You abused me to my face
Your Majesty didnt present yourself as the king
You represented yourself as just a common man
Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine because if youd been what I took you for there would have been no offense
Therefore I beg your Highness pardon me
Ill have none of your money
Its meant in good will
I tell you you can use it to get your shoes fixed
Come why be so hesitant
Your shoes are in pretty bad shape
Its a good shilling I promise you
Now herald have the dead been counted
Here is the count of the slaughtered French
What prisoners of rank have been taken uncle
This paper tells me of ten thousand Frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield
Among them are one hundred twentysix princes and standardbearing nobles
Add to these eight thousand four hundred knights squires and brave gentlemen five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday
Among the ten thousand the French have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries
The rest of the dead are princes barons lords knights squires and gentlemen of birth and rank
Of brave earls Grandpré and Roussi Fauconberg and Foix Beaumont and Marle Vaudemont and Lestrale
Where is the number of our English dead
When was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other in the ordinary and equal clash of battle
Take credit God for it is no ones doing but yours
Its unbelievable
Yes Captain but with this acknowledgementthat God fought for us
Yes I truly think He did great good
Well perform all the holy rites
As for those who have I beg you to excuse the gaps in time and the many people and things that cannot be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form
Lets have him land and solemnly proceed to London
Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath where his lords suggest that he should carry his battlescarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city
He refuses as he is free of vanity and selfserving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God
Now in the factory of thought create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets
Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar
Skip over all the particularities between then and Harrys return to France
Saint Davys Day has passed
There are reasons and causes why and how in everything
We were somewhere where I couldnt pick a fight with him but Ive decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again whereupon Ill give him a little piece of my mind
And here he comes puffing himself up like a turkey
Are you mad
Away
The smell of leek turns my stomach
I wonder if youd be so good you lousy rotten villain to grant my wish and my request and gratify me see by eating this leek
Id like you to see because you dont like it and because it isnt to your taste and because it doesnt agree with you
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats
Heres a goat for you
Dissolute lowlife you shall die
Thats very true mangy rascal when it pleases God
Meanwhile Id be gratified if youd live and eat your food
Come heres some sauce to go with it
Enough Captain
Youve stunned him
I tell you Ill either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a fourday headbashingGo on bite
Its good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin
Must I bite
Yes absolutely no question or ambiguity about it
By this leek I swear Ill make you pay for this
Would you like some more sauce to go with it
There isnt enough leek left for you to swear on
Lay off already
Cant you see Im eating
I sincerely hope it does you good mangy rascal
No dont throw any of it away
The skin is good for your cracked head
When you see leeks in the future I hope you keep mocking them
Good
Yes leeks are good
Wait heres a penny to heal your head
Me a penny
If I owe you anything Ill pay you in clubbings
Youll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me
God be with you and keep you and may he heal your head
Therell be hell to pay for this
Go on get out of here
Youre a lying cowardly wretch
You mock an ancient tradition born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died and then have the gall not to stand by your words
Ive seen you bait and mock this man more than once
You thought because he didnt speak English like a native he couldnt handle an English club
Farewell
Has Fortune turned on me like the whore she is
Ive had news that my Nell died of the pox in a hospice
I grow old and all dignity has been thrashed out of me
Well Ill turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing
Ill steal away to England and Ill steal some more when I get there
Ill bandage up these wounds and swear I got them in the French wars
But heres an old true saying If you want to win France start with Scotland For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and like the mouse when the cats away destroy more than she can actually eat
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home
But that is a false conclusion since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves
While the armed hand fights in foreign lands the wise head defends itself at home
We rejoice to see you most worthy brother of England
You are welcome here as are all of you English princes
We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship
Were here to say amen to that
All you English princes I salute you
Great kings of France and England I owe you both equal service and loyalty
Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that Ive strived mightily with all my wits and energy to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties
Alas she has been too long exiled from France whose crops all lie in heaps rotting with ripeness
Her grapes which make the wine that cheers our hearts die unpruned on the vines
Her oncetrimmed hedges like prisoners with wild untended hair put forth unruly twigs
Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting
The level meadow where the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover once grew has become useless unmowed it grows to seed so that nothing springs up but weeds rough thistles barren plants and burs
children have lostor no longer have time to learnskills that should be a credit to our country
They grow like savageslike soldiers who meditate on nothing but bloodsurrounded by swearing and stern looks ragged clothing and everything unnatural
Duke of Burgundy if you want peace the lack of which creates these misfortunes you describe you must purchase it buy agreeing acrosstheboard to all our very just demands
The king has heard them but as yet has made no answer
Well the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer
Ive only given the articles a cursory glance
If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully I will give my answer and acceptance right away
Fair sister will you go with the princes or stay here with me
Gracious brother I will go with them
Perhaps a womans voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up
In that case leave our cousin Katherine here with us
She is our principal demandone of the first points of the treaty
She is welcome to stay
Lovely most lovely Katherine will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his lovesuit to a gentle heart like yours
Your Majesty shall mock at me
I cannot speak your England
Lovely Katherine if you will love me well with your French heart Im happy to hear you confess it in broken English
Do you like me Kate
Pardon me but I do not know what is like me An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel
I said so dear Katherine and Im not ashamed to repeat it
Kate my wooing is fit for your understanding I am glad your English isnt better
If it were you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think Id sold my farm to buy my crown
I dont know any fancy ways of talking about love only to say right out I love you If you press me any further than with the question Do you really my love scene is over
So give me your answer and well shake on it
Deal
I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other though I have the gift of strength
If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my backthough you may accuse me of boastingI could easily get myself a wife
If you can love a man of this temperament Kate whose face a sunburn wouldnt make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself let your eye improve me
I speak to you as a plain soldier
If you can love me for this take me
If not to tell you I will die is true but not for love by God
And yet I do love you
So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness
These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a ladys good graces always reason themselves out again
If you would have such a man take me
So what do you say to my suit
Speak my fair one and speak fairly I beg you
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France
No it is not possible you should love the enemy of France Kate
But in loving me you would love the friend of France for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it
I will have it all mine
And Kate when France is mine and I am yours then France is yours and you are mine
I dont understand all dat
No Kate
Can any of your neighbors tell Kate
Ill ask them
But mock me gently dear Kate because I love you terribly
Shall we not
What do you say my fair  I do not know dat
No of course you dont
Now there can only be the promise
Do promise Kate that youll do your French part to bring forth such a boy and for my English half take the word of a king and a bachelor
I tell you truly in true English I love you Kate
And though I wouldnt dare to swear that you love me still my blood begins to flatter me that you do despite the ill effects of my face
Curse my fathers ambition
But I promise you Kate the older I grow the better Ill look
My comfort is that old age that poor preserver of beauty cant make my face any worse than it already is
If you have me you have me now at my worst and if you have me youll appreciate me better and better
Therefore tell me fairest Katherine will you have me
Take me by the hand and say Harry of England I am yours No sooner shall I hear that word than I will tell you straight out England is yours Ireland is yours France is yours and Harry Plantagenet
is yours And though I say so in his presence if hes not a friend of the best kings youll find him king of the best friends
Come on tell me in broken musicfor your voice is music and your English broken
Come Katherine Queen of All reveal your heart to me in broken English
Will you have me
Den it shall also content me
With that I kiss your hand and call you my queen
Then I will kiss your lips Kate
What does she say madam interpreter
Dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of FranceI cannot tell vat is  To kiss
It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married is that what she says
Oh Kate prudish customs bow before great kings
You and I cannot be held within the confines of a countrys arbitrary customs dear Kate
You and I Kate we are the makers of custom and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize as I will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss
Therefore willingly and yielding
God save your Majesty
My royal kinsman are you teaching our princess English
I wanted to teach her how perfectly I love her kinsman and thats good English
She picks it up quick doesnt she
So possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery I cant awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness
From this I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common endjust as many arrows shot from different points converge on a single target just as many roads meet in a single town just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea just as the many radiuses of a 
Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic
For love to appear in his true likeness he would have to be as Cupid is naked and blind
How can you blame her a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes for objecting to having a blind naked boy appear before her
Its a lot to ask of a maiden
Theyre forgiven then if they dont see what theyre doing
Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes my lord
So youre telling me to give it time and wait for summer
And even then in order for me to catch the fly your cousin she must be blind
Like love my lord before it learns to love
Fair enough
Shall Kate be my wife
If you wish
I am satisfied as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her
That way the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire
We have consented to all reasonable terms
Is that true my lords of England
The king has agreed to every point first his daughter then everything else as you strictly proposed
Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this titlein French  And even this Im willing to grant if you request it
In that case I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest and bestow your daughter on me
Amen
Now welcome KateAnd let everyone bear witness that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen
May God who is the best matchmaker join your hearts and realms in one
God say Amen
Amen
Let us prepare for our weddingOn that day Ill take your oath of loyalty my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers to guarantee my treaty
Then I will swear to Kate and you to me and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate
Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude inadequate writing keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled historys full glory with his uneven telling
Henry the Sixth crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy succeeded him
With those plays in mind we hope youll receive this one kindly
If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin
Im ready now to hear what my good cousin the Dauphin has to sayfor I hear that the greeting you bear is from him not the king
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message weve been asked to convey
Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections
Divide each man into a thousand and there you will have an imaginary army
Imagine when we talk of horses that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth
I am no tyrant but a Christian king whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons
Therefore tell me the Dauphins mind frankly and without constraint
You cant party your way into dukedoms there
And in return for this gift he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms
This is the Dauphins message
Whats the treasure uncle
Tennis balls my liege
Im happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor
Thank you for his present and your trouble
Once Ive put my rackets to these balls Ill play a set in France God willing that will knock his fathers crown right out of the court
And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days
Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when theyre away from home
So go in peace
And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it
That was a humorous message
I hope to make the sender blush for it
Now lords dont let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition
Therefore let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet
shifts friends to Southampton
From there well safely carry you to France and back calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage
But we wont shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears
Good to see you Corporal Nym
Good day Lieutenant Bardolph
Tell me are you and Ensign Pistol friends again yet
For my part I really dont care
Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France
How about it Corporal Nym
Thats it
Its not for me to say
Things are what they are
Men may sleep and when they do they may have their throats with them and some people say knives have blades
There must be some resolution
Well its not for me to say
Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife
I swear I scorn the word
Oh dear
Pish
Pish to you you mangy dog you pointyeared Icelandic mutt
Corporal Nym be a man and put away your sword
Get lost will you
I am not some fiend of hell you cant get rid of me with spells
Im in a mood to beat you up pretty good
If you get nasty with me Pistol Ill stab you with my sword in fair play
Your grave is gaping open and your death is near
So take your last breath
Listen listen to what I say whoever strikes first Ill run him through with my sword as sure as Im a soldier
Thats an oath of great power and our fury must subside
Thats enough
I swear hell be food for the crows soon
The king has broken his heart
Good husband come home soon
Come on can I get you two to make up
Let rivers flood and fiends howl for food
Are you going to pay the eight shillings I won from you in a bet
Paying debts is for peasants
Im going to take it from you now
Well see wont we
Do your best
By this sword Ill kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust
By this sword I will
By this sword is an oath and oaths must be kept
Come on put it away
In cash
Well then thats how it is
If you ever had a mother come in quickly to Sir John
The poor thing he is so shaken with a fever that its terrible to see
Sweet men come to him
And as the speaker of any prologue should I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly
Nym what you say is true
He has his moods and his ways
How smooth and cool they seem
Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful
The king has been informed of all their plans but they have no idea
Now that the wind is favorable lets board the ship
My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you my noble knight what do you think
Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France achieving and accomplishing everything Ive assembled them to do
No doubt it will my liege if each man does his best
I have no doubt about that since I know there isnt a man among us who isnt with me wholeheartedly or a soul left behind who doesnt wish us success and conquest
There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself your Majesty
I dont think theres a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government
True
Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness serving you loyally and wholeheartedly
Yes I have great cause to be thankful
Uncle of Exeter release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me
Thats merciful but a bit careless
Oh let us be merciful anyway
And now lets turn to our business with the French
Who are the new commissioners
I am one my lord
Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today
You told me to do the same my liege
And me too my royal sovereign
I confess my crime and throw myself on your Highnesss mercy
To which we all appeal
The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice
Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white I can scarcely believe it its so past understanding
All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive put together from shreds
and patches of righteousness
But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor
The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion could return to hell and tell the devils legions I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishmans How you have poisoned my faith in people
Why so did you
Why so did you
Do they come from good families
Why so did you
Do they seem religious
Why so did you
Thats how sound a man you appeared
Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion
This treachery of yours is like the second 
Richard Earl of Cambridge I arrest you for high treason
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham I arrest you for high treason
Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland I arrest you for high treason
I regret my crime more than my death and I beg your Highness to forgive me while punishing my body with death
But I thank God that I failed in my scheme and I rejoice in paying the penalty as I beg God and you to pardon me
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking
Pardon my crime sovereign but not my person
May God in His mercy forgive you
I seek no revenge for myself but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom which you sought to destroy that you must be punished according to her laws
So go to your deaths poor miserable wretches the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure
I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot
Im now sure that every bump in the road has been removed
Lets go forth dear countrymen
Ill be no king of England if Im not also king of France
No because my manly heart is grieving
Bardolph be happyNym rouse your bragging spiritsBoy be brave
Oh no hes surely not in hell
Hes in  They say he cried out against sherry
Yes he did
And women
No he did not
He could never bear carnation
It was a color he never did like
He once said the devil would get him because of women
He did touch on women a bit but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon
Dont you remember how he saw a flea land on Bardolphs nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell
Well the  Shall we get moving
The king will already have left Southampton
Look after my goods and possessions
My lord this bill thats being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henrys reign
Everyone thought it would pass then and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time which required the matter to be put off
But how will we keep it from being passed now my lord
We have to think about that
If it does pass the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand two hundred squires and a hundred wellsupplied almshouses for the relief of lepers oldage pensioners the poor and those too weak or sick to work
Thats what the bill says
But what can be done to prevent it
The king is virtuous and kind
And a true lover of the holy Church
Ive heard thats not the most nourishing food
Kiss her soft mouth and well be off
Farewell hostess
Be thrifty
And keep yourself hidden I command you
Farewell
Adieu
Therefore the dukes of Berri Bretagne Brabant and Orléans shall advance and you Prince Dauphin will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves
The king of Englands approach is as forceful as a whirlpool
Lets do it with no show of anxietyno with no more fear than if wed heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing
Because my good king England is so poorly led her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain silly shallow impulsive youth that shes hardly a threat
Oh please Prince Dauphin
You are completely wrong about this king
Talk to the ambassadors whove just come back ask them how majestically he responded to their message how well supplied he was with good advisors how restrained in expressing his displeasure and moreover how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve
Youll discover that his youthful follies were like the persona that  Well youre wrong my Lord High Constable
But even if I thought you were right it doesnt matter
When it comes to defense its best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems
crowned by the golden sun observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years since they were babies
This king is a branch of that same victorious stock
Ambassadors of Harry king of England request a hearing with your Majesty
Well see them immediately
Bring them right in
My good King surprise the English and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over
Selflove my liege is not so great a sin as selfneglect
From our brother monarch the king of England
And what will happen if I dont
Bloodshed will force you to
Ill think it over
Tomorrow Ill let you know what Ive decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England
Regarding the Dauphin you can speak to me
Whats the message from the English king
Scorn and defiance indifference contempt and any insult that wouldnt disgrace the mighty senderthats the value he puts on you
And my king goes on if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands Henrys artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face
To that end I presented him with the tennis balls the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity
Hell make your palace tremble for this insult even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe
And make no mistake youll find as we his subjects have an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now
Well give you an answer tomorrow
Dont take too long unless you want our king to come after me to ask whats holding things up because hes already landed here
Youll have your answer soon
A night isnt much time for addressing matters of this importance
And so on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought our scene flies swiftly on
Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging
Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub
Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea breasting the high waves
Pretend that youre standing on the shore watching a city dance on the shifting waves and youll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur
Follow it follow it
Once there make your thoughts work harder and witness a siege
Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur
Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him
his daughter Katherine with some insignificant unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry
Indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings
Attack the breach in the city wall once more dear friends attack it once moreor else lets close it up with English corpses
Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare
On on you noblest Englishmen descended as you are from battletested fathers fathers who like so many Alexander the Greats have fought in these regions from morning until night sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight
Dont dishonor your mothers
Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you
And you good farmers whose limbs were made in England show us here the vigor of your upbringing
Prove you are worthy of your birth which I do not doubt for a moment
We are fortunate in the change
Listen to him talk about war and youll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles
Follow your spirit and as you charge cry God for Harry England and Saint George
On on on on on
To the breach to the breach
Please corporal stop
You can see how it is all around
I wish I were in an alehouse in London
I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety
Me too
Up to the breach you dogs
Go
Great Duke be merciful to mortal men
Dear man calm your rage
Be lenient dearest
This is healthy talk
Your Honors is unhealthy talk
Young though I am Ive been observing these three blowhards closely
Yet not one among them if all three were to wait on me could be my man because three such fakes dont amount to a man
They will steal anything and call it spoils
They would like me to be as familiar with mens pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs which goes against my manhood because to take something from anothers pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing
I must leave them and seek some better employment
Their villainy nauseates me and I must therefore vomit it up
The tunnels
For the enemy seeand you can explain this to the duke seehas dug its own tunnels four yards below ours
By Jesus I think they will blow up everything if we dont improve our tactics
The duke of Gloucester who has command over the siege is in consultation with an Irishman a very valiant gentleman indeed
Its Captain Macmorris right
I think so
Jesus hes an ass if there ever was one
I will say as much to his face
He knows no more about the proper practice of war seethe ancient practicesthan a puppy
Here he comes with Captain Jamy the Scots captain
Captain Jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman thats certain one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare I happen to know from his maneuvers
By Jesus he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient Roman wars as well as any military man in the world
Good day to you Captain Fluellen
Good evening to your Worship good Captain James
Tell me Captain Macmorris have you left the tunnels
Have the excavators stopped work
Christ its a disaster
I swear by this hand and my fathers soul the whole thing is a disaster
Its all stopped
I could have blown up the town in an hour
Oh its a disaster a disaster by this hand its a disaster
Captain Macmorris I beg your pardon but would you grant me a discussion or two with you see partly touching on or concerning the practice of war the Roman wars for the sake of argument see and friendly conversation
Partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction see of my mind with respect to the demands of proper military practicethats the point
What endeavor Popillius
Good luck
Look hes approaching Caesar
Keep an eye on him
Brutus what will we do
If our secrets known either Caesar or I will die for Ill kill myself
Cassius stand firm
Trebonius knows his cue
Wheres Metellus Cimber
He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now
Theyre speaking to him
Go up there and second his petition
Casca youll be the first to raise your hand
Are we all ready
I have to stop you Cimber
These kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men flattering them into turning Roman law into childrens games
What even you Brutus
I could be convinced if I were like you
If I could beg others to change their minds begging would convince me too
But Im as immovable as the northern star whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky
The sky shows countless stars
So it is on earth
To show you that thats me let me prove it a little even in this case
Enough
Would you try to lift Mount Olympus
Havent I resisted even Brutus begging from his knees
Hands speak for me
Liberty
Freedom
Tyranny is dead
Run and proclaim it in the streets
Some should go to the public platforms and cry out Liberty freedom and democracy People and senators dont be afraid
Dont run awaystay where you are
Go to the platform Brutus
And Cassius too
Wheres Publius
Stand close together in case someone loyal to Caesar tries to Dont talk about standing togetherPublius cheer up
We dont intend any harm to you nor to anyone else
Tell them this Publius
And leave us Publius in case the people storming us should harm you
Do so
And let no one suffer for this deed except us the perpetrators
Wheres Antony
He ran to his house stunned
Men wives and children stare cry out and run in the streets as though it were doomsday
Why the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death
Kneel Romans kneel and lets wash our hands up to the elbows in Caesars blood and smear it on our swords
Then well go out even to the marketplace and waving our bloody swords over our heads lets cry Peace freedom and liberty Kneel then and wash
Whos calling me
Quiet everyone
Quiet
Who in the crowd is calling me
I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling Caesar Speak
Caesar is listening
Beware of March 15th
Whos that
A soothsayer tells you to beware of March 15th
Bring him in front of me
Let me see his face
You fellow step out of the crowd
This is Caesar youre looking at
What do you have to say to me now
Speak once again
Beware of March 15th
Hes insane
Lets leave him
Lets move
Are you going to watch the race
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show though he now lies at the base of Pompeys statue as worthless as dust
Yes every man forward
Brutus will lead and well follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome
Wait a minute
Whos that coming
Its a friend of Antonys  
Your master is a wise and honorable Roman
I never thought any less of him
Tell him if he comes here Ill explain everything to him and on my word hell leave unharmed
I know that hell be on our side
But here comes AntonyWelcome Mark Antony
Oh mighty Caesar
Do you lie so low
Have all your conquests glories triumphs achievements come to so little
Farewell
Gentlemen I dont know what you intend to do who else you intend to kill who else you consider corrupt
If its me theres no time as good as this hour of Caesars death and no weapon better than your swords covered with the noblest blood in the world
I ask you if you have a grudge against me to kill me now while your stained hands still reek of blood
I could live a thousand years and I wouldnt be as ready to die as I am now
Theres no place Id rather die than here by Caesar and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you the masters of this new era
Oh Antony dont beg us to kill you
They are full of pity for Caesar
But a stronger pity for the wrongs committed against Rome drove out our pity for Caesar as fire drives out fire and so we killed him
For you our swords have blunt edges too dull to harm you Mark Antony
Our arms which can be strong and cruel and our hearts filled with brotherly love embrace you with kind love good thoughts and reverence
Your vote will be as strong as anyones in the reordering of the government
But just be patient until weve calmed the masses who are beside themselves with fear
I dont doubt your wisdom
Each of you give me your bloody hand
Mark Antony Pardon me Caius Cassius
I took your hands in friendship but indeed I was distracted when I looked down at Caesar
I am friends with you all and love you all on one conditionthat you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous
Our reasons are so well considered that even if you Antony were Caesars son you would be satisfied with them
You may Mark Antony
Brutus may I have a word with you   
Itll help us more than hurt us
Mark Antony take Caesars body
You will not blame us in your funeral speech but will say all the good you want to about Caesar and that you do it by our permission
And youll speak on the same platform as I do after Im done
So be it
I dont want anything more
Prepare the body then and follow us
You are whats left of the noblest man that ever lived
Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood
Over your woundswhich like speechless mouths open their red lips as though to beg me to speakI predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men
Fierce civil war will paralyze all of Italy
I do Mark Antony
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome
He received Caesars letters and he is coming
Grief seems to be contagious for my eyes seeing the tears in yours began to fill
Is your master coming
He rests tonight within twentyone miles of Rome
Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened
Dont go back until Ive carried the corpse into the marketplace
Help me here
We want answers
Give us answers
Then follow me and listen to my speech friends
Cassius go to the next street and divide the crowd
Let those who will hear me speak stay
Lead those away who will follow you and well explain publicly the reasons for Caesars death
Ill listen to Brutus
Ill listen to Cassius and we will compare their reasons
Noble Brutus has mounted the platform
Be patient until I finish
Romans countrymen and friends
Listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear
Believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind so you may believe me
Be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly
If theres anyone in this assembly any dear friend of Caesars I say to him that my love for Caesar was no less than his
If then that friend demands to know why I rose up against Caesar this is my answer its not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more
Would you rather that Caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves or that Caesar were dead and we all lived as free men
I weep for Caesar in that he was good to me
I rejoice in his good fortune
I honor him for being brave
But his ambitionfor that I killed him
There are tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his bravery and death for his ambition
Who here is so low that he wants to be a slave
If there are any speak for it is he whom Ive offended
Who here is so barbarous that he doesnt want to be a Roman
If there are any speak for it is he whom Ive offended
Who here is so vile that he doesnt love his country
If there are any speak for it is he whom I have offended
I will pause for a reply
No one Brutus no one
Then I have offended no one
Ive done no more to Caesar than you will do to me
The reasons for his death are recorded in the Capitol
His glory has not been diminished where he earned it nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated
Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who though he had no part in the killing will benefit from his deathreceiving a share in the commonwealth as you all will
Live Brutus
Live live
Lets carry him in triumph to his house
I dont like sports
Im not competitive like Antony
But dont let me keep you from going Cassius
Ill go my own way
Cassius dont take it badly
Tell me good Brutus can you see your face
Let him become Caesar
Caesars better qualities exist in Brutus and we will crown him
Well bring him to his house with shouts and celebration
My countrymen Silence
Brutus speaks
Quiet there
Good countrymen let me leave alone
I ask that none of you leave except myself until Antony has finished
Let him mount the pulpit
Well listen to him
For Brutuss sake I am indebted to you  
What does he say about Brutus
He says that for Brutuss sake he finds himself indebted to us all
Hed better not speak badly of Brutus here
Caesar was a tyrant
Thats for sure
Were lucky that Rome is rid of him
Quiet
Lets hear what Antony has to say
You gentle Romans Quiet there
Let us hear him
Friends Romans countrymen give me your attention
I have come here to bury Caesar not to praise him
The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths but the good is often buried with them
It might as well be the same with Caesar
The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious
If thats true its a serious fault and Caesar has paid seriously for it
With the permission of Brutus and the othersfor Brutus is an honorable man they are all honorable menI have come here to speak at Caesars funeral
He was my friend he was faithful and just to me
But Brutus says he was ambitious and Brutus is an honorable man
He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city
Is this the work of an ambitious man
When the poor cried Caesar cried too
Ambition shouldnt be so soft
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious and Brutus is an honorable man
You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a kings crown three times and he refused it three times
Was this ambition
I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said but to say what  I think theres a lot of sense in what he says
If you think about it correctly Caesar has suffered a great wrong
Has he sirs
Caesar wouldnt take the crown
Therefore its certain that he wasnt ambitious
If it turns out he wasnt certain people are going to get it
Poor man
Antonys eyes are fiery red from crying
There isnt a nobler man than Antony in all of Rome
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world
Now he lies there worth nothing and no one is so humble as to show him respect
Oh sirs if I stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage I would offend Brutus and Cassius who you all know are honorable men
I will not do them wrong
I would rather wrong the dead and wrong myself and you than wrong such honorable men
But heres a paper with Caesars seal on it
If you could only hear this testamentwhich excuse me I dont intend to read aloudyou would kiss dead Caesars wounds and dip your handkerchiefs in his sacred blood and beg for a lock of hair to remember him by
We want to hear the will
Read it Mark Antony
The will the will
We want to hear Caesars will
It isnt proper for you to know how much Caesar loved you
You arent wood you arent stonesyoure men
And being men the contents of Caesars will would enrage you
Read the will
We want to hear it Antony
You have to read us the will Caesars will
Will you be patient
Will you wait awhile
Ive said too much in telling you of it
Im afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar
They were traitors
The testament
They were villains murderers
The will
Read the will
You force me to read the will then
Then make a circle around Caesars corpse and let me show you the man who made this will
Shall I come down
Will you let me
Come down
Descend
Well let you
Stand away from the hearse
Stand away from the body
Make room for Antony most noble Antony
No dont press up against me
Stand further away
Stand back
Give him room
If you have tears prepare to shed them now
You all know this cloak
I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on
It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors
Look heres where Cassiuss dagger pierced it
See the wound that Casca made
For Brutus as you know was Caesars angel
The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him
This was the most unkind cut of all
And at the base of Pompeys statue with his cloak covering his face which was dripping with blood the whole time great Caesar fell
Oh what a fall it was my countrymen
Then you and I and all of us fell down while bloody treason triumphed
Oh now you weep and I sense that you feel pity
These are gracious tears
But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesars wounded cloak how will you feel kind men now
Look at this here is the manscarred as you can see by traitors 
Oh what a sad sight
Oh noble Caesar
Oh sad day
Oh traitors villains
Oh most bloody sight
Revenge
Seek
Burn
Set fire
Kill
Slay
Wait countrymen
Quiet there
Listen to the noble Antony
Those who have done this deed are honorable
I dont know what private grudges they had that made them do it
Theyre wise and honorable and will no doubt give you reasons for it
I havent come to steal your loyalty friends
I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up
I just speak directly
But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me then Id stir you up and install in each of Caesars wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny
Well mutiny
Well burn Brutuss house
Lets go then
Come find the conspirators
Wait and listen to me countrymen
Quiet
Wait
Listen to Antony
Most noble Antony
Why friends you dont even know what youre doing yet
What has Caesar done to deserve your love
Alas you dont know
I must tell you then
Youve forgotten the will I told you about
Yes
The will
Lets stay and hear the will
Most noble Caesar
Well revenge his death
Oh royal Caesar
Listen to me patiently
Quiet there
Also hes left you all his walkwaysin his private gardens and newly planted orchardson this side of the Tiber River
Hes left them to you and to your heirs foreverpublic pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax
Here was a Caesar
When will there be another like him
Well burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors houses on fire
Take up the body
Well start a fire
Now let it work
Whats up my man
Sir Octavius has already arrived in Rome
Where is he
He and Lepidus are at Caesars house
I will go straight to visit him
I ask for him and he comes
Fortune is happy today and in this mood will give us anything we want
I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome
They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people
Take me to Octavius
Thats true
And its too bad Brutus that you dont have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself
Ive heard many of the noblest Romansnext to immortal Caesarspeaking of you complaining of the tyranny of todays government and wishing that your eyes were working better
What dangers are you trying to lead me into Cassius that you want me to look inside myself for something thats not there
Ill tell you good Brutus
And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection Ill be your mirror and show you without exaggeration things inside you that you cant see
And dont be suspicious of me noble Brutus
If I were your average fool or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody or if youd seen me first flattering men hugging them tightly and later slandering them behind their backs or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble only then of course go ahead and assume Im dangerous
Why are they shouting
Im afraid the people have made Caesar their king
Really are you afraid of that
Then I have to assume you dont want him to be king
I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination
I have no desire to go outside yet something leads me there
Whats your name
Where are you going
Where do you live
Are you a married man or a bachelor
Answer all of us now
Yes and be brief
Yes and be wise
Whats my name
Where am I going
Where do I live
Am I a married man or a bachelor
Then to answer every man briefly wisely and truthfullywisely I say I am a bachelor
You imply that married men are fools
Youll get a blow from me for that I think
Right this instant Im going to Caesars funeral
As a friend or an enemy
As a friend
Getting right to the point I live near the Capitol
Tell us your name sir truthfully
Truthfully my name is Cinna
Tear him to pieces
Hes a conspirator
Im not Cinna the conspirator
It doesnt matter
His names Cinna
Pull only his name out of his heart and let him go
Tear him apart tear him up
Come firebrands over here
To Brutuss to Cassiuss lets burn them all
Some of you go to Deciuss house and some to Cascas
Some to Ligariuss
Go
These ones then will be assassinated
Their names are marked
I agree Put a mark next to his name too Antony
On the condition that your sisters son Publius also must die Mark Antony
He will die
SeeIve sealed his fate with this mark next to his name
But Lepidus go to Caesars house
Bring his will here and well figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people
Will you be here when I return
Either here or at the Capitol
Hes an unremarkable man fit only to be sent on errands
Does it really make sense once we divide the world into three parts that he should be one of the three rulers
Octavius Im older than you are
And although were giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what were doing hell carry these honors like a jackass carries goldgroaning and sweating under the load either led or pushed as we direct him
Once hes carried our treasure where we want it well free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures
You can do what you want but hes an experienced and honorable soldier
So is my horse Octavius and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants
Stop
Pass on the command to halt
Whats happening now Lucillius
Is Cassius nearby
Hes nearby and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master
If hes nearby I want an explanation
Can I have a word with you Lucillius
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect but not with affection nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me
Youve described a warm friend whos cooling off
Plain and simple loyalty doesnt make anyone act phony
But insincere men like horses who are too lively at the start of a race make a big show of their spirit
But when push comes to shove they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl
Is his army approaching
They plan to spend the night in Sardis
The larger part the main body of cavalry are coming with Cassius
Look
Hes arrived
March to meet him at a dignified pace
Halt
Halt
Pass the order along
Halt
Halt
Halt
Most noble brother you have done me wrong
Let the gods judge me
Do I mistreat even my enemies
And when you do Cassius calm down
Lets not argue here in front of both our armies which ought to see nothing but love between us
Order them to move back
Then in my tent you can elaborate on your complaints and Ill listen
Pindarus order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground
Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door
My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians and you ignored my letters where I argued that he was innocent I know the man
You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man
In a time like this it doesnt make sense to criticize every offense
Ill tell you Cassius you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold
Me greedy
You know if you were anyone other than Brutus that speech would be your last
The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions and so they go unpunished
Unpunished
Remember March March 15th
Didnt great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice
Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice
Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on
Id rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman
Brutus do not provoke me
I will not take it
Youre forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner
Im a soldier more experienced than you and better able to give orders
Get lost
You are not Cassius
I am
I say youre not
Dont provoke me any further or Ill forget to restrain myself
If you care about your health you wont push me any further
Leave you little man
Is this possible
Listen to me for I have something to tell you
Does a madman scare me when he stares at me
But why do you keep me here so long
What do you want to tell me
I know this quality in you Brutusits as familiar to me as your face
Indeed honor is what I want to talk to you about
I dont know what you and other men think of this life but as for me Id rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself
I was born as free as Caesar
So were you
We both have eaten as well and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he
Once on a cold and windy day when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks Caesar said to me Cassius I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there As soon as he spoke though I was fully dressed I plunged in and called for him to follow
And he did
But before we reached the end point Caesar cried Help me Cassius or I will sink And just as Aeneas the hero who founded Rome emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar
All this
Yes and more
Go aheadrage till your proud heart breaks
Show your slaves how mad you are and make your servants tremble
Has it come to this
You say youre a better soldier
Show it
Make your boasts come true and Ill be thrilled
Im always happy to hear about brave men
You wrong me in every way
You wrong me Brutus
When Caesar was alive even he wouldnt dare anger me like this
Oh be quiet
You wouldnt have dared to tempt him so
I wouldnt have dared
No
You wouldnt have dared out of fear for your life
Dont take my love for granted
I might do something Ill be sorry for
Youve already done something you should be sorry for
Your threats dont scare me Cassius because Im so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze
I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers and you wouldnt give it to me
Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew
And would I have ever done that to you
I didnt refuse you
You did
I didnt
The man who brought my answer to you was a fool
You have broken my heart
A friend should put up with his friends weaknesses but you exaggerate mine
I dont until you practice them on me
You dont love me
I dont like your faults
A friend would never see those faults
No a flatterer wouldnt even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus
Oh I could weep my soul right out of myself
Theres my dagger  Put away your dagger
Be angry whenever you like its all right with me
Do whatever you want and Ill say your insults are just a bad mood
When I said that I was angry too
You admit it then
Give me your hand
And my heart too
Oh Brutus
Whats the matter
Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper which I inherited from my mother makes me forget how I should behave
Yes Cassius
And from now on when you get hot with me Ill assume its your mother speaking and leave it at that      
Whats this
Whats the matter
You should be ashamed generals
What do you think youre doing
Love each other and be friends like two such men should be
Listen to me because Im older than you surely
Be patient with him Brutus
Thats just how he is
Ill humor him when he learns how to behave
What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post
Get out of here my friend
Away away be gone
Lucillius and Titinius order the commanders to have the men camp for the night
And return to us immediately bringing Messala with you
I didnt think you could even be so angry
Oh Cassius Im tired out by many sorrows
Portia is dead
Portia
She is dead
What an irreplaceable and grievous loss
What sickness did she die of
She was worried about my absence and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strongwhich I found out at the same time as the news of her death
And thats how she died
Yes like that
Oh immortal gods
My heart is thirsty for that noble promise
Fill my cup Lucius until the wine overflows it
I cannot drink too much of Brutuss love
Now lets sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs
Portia are you really gone
No more about that please
Messala I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power
I have received letters that say the same
And anything else
That with a series of legal writs Octavius Antony and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death
On that point our letters dont agree
My letters say only seventy senators were killed one being Cicero
Cicero too
Cicero is dead by their decree
No Messala
And you havent heard any news about her in your letters
Nothing Messala
I think thats strange
Why do you ask
Have you heard something of her in your letters
No my lord
Now as youre a Roman tell me the truth
Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman
Its certain that she is dead and she died in a strange way
Well goodbye Portia
We all must die Messala
Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime I can endure her death now
Thats the way great men ought to endure great losses
Ive practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you but I still couldnt bear this news like you do
Well lets move on to our work with the living
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately
I dont think its a good idea
Why not
Heres why itd be better for the enemy to come after us
That way hell waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers weakening his own capacities while we lying still are rested energetic and nimble
If we meet him at Philippi these people will be at our backs
Listen to me good brother
Our regiments are full to the brim our cause is ready
The enemy gets larger each day
We now at our largest can only decrease
Its on such a high tide that were now floating and we must take the current when it is offered or lose our campaign
If thats what you want all right
Well go forward with you and meet them at Philippi
Its now late at night and actions must accommodate bodily needs which well satisfy with only a short rest
Thats all there is to say
Theres nothing else
Good night
Well rise and leave early tomorrow
Lucius
Lets pray that we never come into conflict like that again
Lets not Brutus
And this is the man who has now become a god and Im a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way
In Spain Caesar had a fever and it made him shake
Its true this socalled godhe shook
His cowardly lips turned white and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam
I heard him groanyes I didand the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried Give me some water Titinius like a sick girl
It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone
More shouting
I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar
Why Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably as slaves
Men can be masters of their fate
It is not destinys fault but our own faults that were slaves
Brutus and Caesar Whats so special about Caesar
Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours
Write them togetheryours is just as good a name
Pronounce themit is just as nice to say
Everythings fine
Good night my lord
Good night good brother
Good night Lord Brutus
Farewell everyone
Give me the gown
Wheres your lute
Here in the tent
What are you sleepy
Call Claudio and some of my other men
Ill have them sleep on cushions in my tent
Varrus and Claudio
Did you call my lord
Sirs I ask you to sleep in my tent
I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius
If you like well stand by and wait to do whatever you need
Look Lucius heres the book I was searching for
I put it in the pocket of my nightgown
I was sure that you hadnt given it to me
Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute
Yes my lord if you would like
I would my boy
I ask too much of you but youre always willing
Its my duty sir
I shouldnt make you do more than youre able
I know that young men look forward to their rest
Ive already slept my lord
That was good planning and youll sleep some more
I wont keep you very long
If I live through this Ill be good to you
This is a sleepy tune
Gentle boy good night
I wont trouble you so much as to wake you
Good night good boy
Let me see let me see
Didnt I turn down the page where I left off reading
Here it is I think
I think its my bad eyesight thats making me see this horrible vision
Its coming toward me
Are you a god an angel or a devil that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up
Tell me what you are
Im your evil spirit Brutus
Why do you come here
To tell you that youll see me at Philippi
Then Ill see you again
Yes at Philippi
Alright then Ill see you at Philippi
Evil spirit I want to talk some more
Claudio
Claudio
He thinks hes still playing his instrument
Lucius wake up
My lord
Were you dreaming Lucius
My lord I dont think I cried out
Yes you did
Did you see anything
Nothing my lord
My lord
My lord
Why did you cry out in your sleep
Did we my lord
Yes
Did you see anything
No my lord I didnt see anything
Me neither my lord
Go to my brother Cassius
Order him to advance his forces first thing and well follow
Yes my lord
Now Antony our prayers have been answered
You said the enemy wouldnt come down but keep to the hills and upper regions
It seems not
Their forces are nearby
They intend to challenge us here at Philippi responding to our challenge before weve even challenged him
I know how they think and I understand why theyre doing this
They really wish they were somewhere else but they want to descend on us looking fierce so well think theyre brave
But they arent
Prepare yourselves generals
The enemy approaches with great display
They show their bloody heralds of battle and something must be done immediately
Octavius lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field
Ill go to the right side
You stay on the left
Why are you defying me in this urgent matter
They want to talk
Stay here Titinius
We have to go out and talk to them
Mark Antony should we give the signal to attack
No Octavius Caesar well respond to their charge
Go forward
The generals want to speak with us
Words before fighting
Is that how it is countrymen
Not that we love words more than fighting like you do
Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius
Brutus you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes
But your words are as sweet as honeyyouve stolen from the bees and left them with nothing
I took their stings too wouldnt you say
Villains you didnt do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesars sides
Now Brutus you have only yourself to thank
Come come lets remember why were here
If arguing makes us sweat the real trial will turn that water to blood
Caesar youre not going to be killed by a traitorunless you kill yourself
I hope youre right
I wasnt born to die on your sword
If you were the noblest of your family young man you couldnt die more honorably
An annoying schoolboy unworthy of such an honor joined by a masquerader and a partier
Still the same old Cassius
If you dare to fight today come to the field
If not come when you have the courage
Now let the wind blow waves swell and ships sink
The storm has begun and everything is at stake
Messala
Messala today is my birthdayI was born on this very day
Give me your hand Messala
Youll be my witness that Ive been forced as Pompey was to wager all of our freedoms on one battle
You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens
Ive changed my mind now and partly believe in omens
Traveling from Sardis two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there eating from the hands of the soldiers whod accompanied us to Philippi
This morning theyve flown away and in their place are ravens crows and kites flying over our heads and looking down on us as though we were sickly prey
Their shadows are like a deadly canopy under which our army lies ready to die
Dont believe in this
I only partly believe it for Im enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering
Now most noble Brutus the gods are friendly with us today so that we who want peace can live on to old age
But since the affairs of men are always uncertain lets think about the worst that may happen
If we lose this battle this is the last time well speak to each other
If we lose what do you plan to do
Cast spells with them and Brutus will call up a ghost as well as Caesar Now in the name of all the gods I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great
Our era should be ashamed
Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men
When was there ever an age since the beginning of time that didnt feature more than one famous man
Until now no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome
Now though in all of Rome theres room for only one man
You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutusyour ancestorwho wouldve let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule
I have no doubt that you love me
Im beginning to understand what you want me to do
What I think about this and about whats happening here in Rome Ill tell you later
For now dont try to persuade me anymoreI ask you as a friend
Ill think over what youve said Ill listen patiently to whatever else you have to say and Ill find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters
Until then my noble friend think about this Id rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through
Im glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you
Then if we lose this battle youll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome
No Cassius no
Dont imagine that Ill ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains
My mind is too great for that
Therefore accept my everlasting farewell
Forever and forever farewell Cassius
If we meet again then well smile
If not then this parting was well done
Forever and forever farewell Brutus
If we meet again then well smile indeed
If not its true this parting was well done
Well lead on
Oh I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens
But its enough to know that the day will end and then the end will be known
Lets go
Ride ride Messala ride and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side
They should advance immediately because I sense Octaviuss side is a bit fainthearted right now and a sudden push would overthrow him
Ride ride Messala
Ive become an enemy to my own soldiers
Oh Cassius Brutus gave the orders too soon
Retreat further my lord retreat further
Mark Antony is in your tents my lord
Therefore you must run noble Cassius
Are those my tents on fire
They are my lord
Titinius if you love me get on your horse and spur him on until hes brought you to those troops and back again so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies
Ill be back quicker than you can think a thought
Go Pindarus climb a little higher on this hill
My eyesight has always been bad
Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field
Today was the day I breathed my first breath
Time has come round and Ill end where I began
My life has run its circle
What news
And listen
They shout for joy
Come down look no more
Oh Im such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes
Come here boy
Come now keep your oath
Caesar you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you
So Im free
But I didnt want to be free like this
Oh Cassius Ill run far from this country to where no Romans can find me
The armies have merely changed places Titinius because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutuss forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassiuss legions
This news will comfort Cassius
Where did you leave him
On this hill and in despair with his slave Pindarus
Isnt that him on the ground
He doesnt seem to be alive
Oh my heart
Isnt that him
Pindarus
Where are you Pindarus
Look for him Titinius while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news
I say force because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this
Hurry Messala and Ill look for Pindarus in the meantime
Why did you send me out brave Cassius
Didnt I meet up with your allies
And didnt they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you
Didnt you hear their shouts
Alas you misunderstood everything
But let me place this wreath on your head
Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you and Ill do what he says
Where is his body Messala
Over there where Titinius mourns it
Titinius is lying faceup
Hes been killed
Oh Julius Caesar you are still powerful
Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs
Could you have found two Romans as good as these two
Goodbye to you the last of all the Romans
I will find the time to cry for you Cassius Ill find the time
Come then and send his body to Thasos
Lets proceed to the field
Labio and Flavio push our armies onward
It is three oclock and Romans before night we will try our luck in a second battle
Who is so low that he wouldnt
Who will advance with me
I will proclaim my name around the field
I am the son of Marcus Cato
An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country
I am the son of Marcus Cato
And I am Brutus Marcus Brutus
Brutus my countrys friend
Know that I am Brutus
Oh young and noble Cato have you been slain
Id rather die
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately
Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing
We must not
He is a noble prisoner
Make room
Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken
Ill tell him the news
Where is he
Hes safe Antony
I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive
The gods protect him from so great a shame
The games are done and Caesar is returning
As they pass by grab Casca by the sleeve and hell tell you if anything important happened todayin his usual sour way
Ill do so
But look Cassius Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if theyve been scolded
Calphurnias face is pale and Ciceros eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol
Casca will tell us whats the matter
Antonio
Caesar    
Come last of my friends rest on this rock
Statilius waved the torchlight at us but he hasnt come back
Hes been captured or killed
Sit down Clitus
Listen Clitus
Who me my lord
No not for all the world
Silence then
Dont give it away
Id rather kill myself
Listen Dardanius
Would I dare do something like that
Oh Dardanius
Oh Clitus    
Come here good Volumnius
Listen a minute
What is it my lord
Once at Sardis and once last night here in Philippi fields
I know that my hour has come
No it hasnt my lord
No Im sure it has Volumnius
You see how the world goes Volumnius
Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave
Its nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us
Good Volumnius you know that we went to school together
For the sake of our old friendship I ask you hold my sword handle while I run on it
Thats not a job for a friend my lord
Run run my lord
We cant wait here
Farewell to you and you and you Volumnius
Strato youve slept this whole time
Ill have glory in this losing daymore than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest
So farewell all for my tongue has almost finished with its life
I cant see ahead of me
My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour
Run my lord run
Go on
Ill follow
I beg you Strato stay by me
Youre a man with a good reputation
Your life has had honor in it
Then hold my sword and turn your face away while I run on it
Will you Strato
Give me your hand first 
Farewell good Strato
What man is that
Free from the bondage you are in Messala
Ill take all who served Brutus into my service
You will you join with me
Yes if Messala recommends me to you
Do so good Messala
How did my master die Strato
I held the sword and he ran on it
Then take this man into your service Octavius for he did the final service to my master
This was the noblest Roman of them all
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar
Only he acted from honesty and for the general good
His life was gentle and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world This was a man Lets treat him according to his virtue with all the respect and rituals of burial
His body will lie in my tent tonight with the honorable observance that suits a soldier
So order the armies to rest and lets go home to share the glories of this happy day
Yes Casca
Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood
But you were with him werent you
If I were I wouldnt need to ask you what happened
A crown was offered to him and he pushed it away with the back of his hand like thisand then the people started shouting
What was the second noise for
The same thing
They shouted three times
What was the last cry for
For the same thing
The crown was offered to him three times
Yes indeed it was and he pushed it away three times each time more gently than the last and at each refusal my countrymen shouted
Who offered him the crown
Antony
Tell us how it happened noble Casca
I cant explain it
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crownthough it wasnt a real crown just a small circletand as I told you he refused it oncethough in my opinion he wouldve liked to have it
Then Antony offered it to him again and he refused it again though in my opinion he was reluctant to take his hand off it
Then Antony offered it the third time
As for myself I didnt dare laugh for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air
But wait a minute please
Did you say Caesar fainted
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless
Thats very likely
He has epilepsy a disease where you fall down
No Caesar doesnt have epilepsy
You and I and honest Casca we have epilepsyweve fallen
I dont know what you mean by that but Im sure Caesar fell down
What did he say when he regained consciousness
Indeed before he fell down when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut
If Id been a common laborer and hadnt taken him up on his offer to hell with me
And so he fainted
When he regained consciousness again he said that if hed done or said anything wrong he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness
Three or four women near me cried Alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts
But never mind themif Caesar had stabbed their mothers they wouldve forgiven him
And after that he came back here looking so serious
Yes
Get out of here
Go home you lazy men
What is today a holiday
Im a carpenter sir
Where are your leather apron and your ruler
What are you doing wearing your best clothes
And you sir whats  Well compared to a fine workman you might call me a mere cobbler
But whats your trade
Answer me straightforwardly
It is a trade sir that I practice with a clear conscience
What trade boy
You insolent rascal what trade
Sir please dont be angry
But if your soles are worn out I can mend you
What do you mean by that
Mend me you impertinent fellow
Did Cicero say anything
Yes he said something in Greek
What did he say
If I told you I understood Greek Id be lying
But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads
As for myself it was Greek to me
I have more news too
Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar
There you go
There was even more foolishness if I could only remember it
Will you have dinner with me tonight Casca
No I have a commitment
Will you dine with me tomorrow
Yes if Im still alive and youre still sane and your dinner is worth eating
Good
Ill expect you
Do so
Farewell to you both
What a stupid man hes become
He was so sharp when he was in school
Hes still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise though he puts on this show of stupidity
He speaks roughly but what he says is smart and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him
Youre right thats how it is
Ill leave you for now
If youd like to talk tomorrow Ill come to your home
Or if you dont mind come to my home and Ill wait for you
Ill do so
Until then think about the wellbeing of Rome
Well Brutus youre noble
Caesar resents me but he loves Brutus
If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me I wouldnt have let him influence me
Tonight Ill throw through his window a few letters in different handwritingas if they came from several citizensall testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus and all alluding to Caesars unseemly ambition
Did you accompany Caesar home
Cicero Ive seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees and Ive seen the ocean swell rage and foam as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds but never before tonight never until now have I experienced a storm that drops fire
Either there are wars in heaven or else the world too insolent toward the gods provokes them to send destruction
AlsoIve kept my sword unsheathed since I saw thisin front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me
And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets
And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon
When all these extraordinary things happen at once we shouldnt say These happenings can be explained rationally
Theyre natural enough I think these things are omens of things to come in our country
Indeed its a strange time
But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves
Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow
He is because he told Antonius to tell you hed be there tomorrow
Good night then Casca
This bad weather isnt good to walk around in
A Roman
Its CascaI know your voice
Your ear is good
Cassius what a night this is
Its a very pleasing night to honest men
Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this
Those who have known how bad things are here on earth
I have walked around the streets exposing myself to the perilous night unbuttoned like this as you see Casca baring my chest to the thunderbolt
When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky I put myself right where I thought it would hit
But why did you tempt the heavens like that
Mankinds role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals
Youre acting stupid Casca and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should haveor else you dont use them
You go pale you stare and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens
A man no mightier than you or I in ability yet grown as huge and frightening as tonights strange happenings
Let it be who it is
Our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak like women
Indeed they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow and hell wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy
I know where Ill wear this dagger then
Ill kill myself to save myself from slavery
In suicide gods make the weak strong
In suicide gods allow tyrants to be defeated
No stony tower no brass walls no airless dungeon no iron chains can contain a strong mind
But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles he can always kill himself
Let everyone beware I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose
So can I
In fact every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself
How can Caesar be a tyrant then
Poor man
I know he wouldnt be a wolf if the Romans didnt act like sheep
He couldnt be a lion if the Romans werent such easy prey
People who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs
But oh no
What have I said in my grief
Say no more
Shake my hand
If youre joining together to right these wrongs Ill go as far as any one of you
Thats a deal
Now let me tell you Casca I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission
And I know that by now theyre waiting for me on the porch outside Pompeys theater
Its Cinna
I recognize his walk
To find you
Whos that
Metellus Cimber
No its Casca someone whos going to work with us
Arent the others waiting for me Cinna
Im glad Casca is with us
What a fearful night this is
Two or three of us have seen strange things
Are the others waiting
Tell me
Yes they are
Oh Cassius if you could only convince Brutus to join us Dont worry
Good Cinna take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judges chair where Brutus sits so hell find it
When youve finished all this return to the porch of Pompeys theater where youll find us
Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
Everyones there except Metellus Cimber and hes gone to look for you at your house
Well Ill hurry and put these papers where you told me
When youve finished go back to Pompeys theater
Come on Casca you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise
Yes youre absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him
Lets go because its already after midnight and we want him on our side before daylight
Wake up I say
Lucius
Did you call me my lord
Put a candle in my study Lucius
Call me when its lit
I will my lord
I have no personal reason to strike at himonly the best interest of the people
He wants to be crowned
The question is how would being king change him
Evil can come from good just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny dayswhich means we have to walk carefully
If we crown him I have to admit wed be giving him the power to do damage
Cobble you sir
Youre a cobbler are you
Sir I make my living using an awl
Im a surgeon to old shoes
When theyre endangered I save them
The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork
But why arent you in your shop today
Why are you leading these men through the streets
Well to wear out their shoes and get myself more work
Why would you celebrate it
What victory does he bring home
What foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels
Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion
Caesar might act like that
Therefore in case he does we must hold him back
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior not what he does now I must frame the argument like this if his position is furthered his character will fulfill these predictions
The candle is burning in your study sir
While I was looking for a flint to light it I found this paper on the window sealed up like this and Im sure it wasnt there when I went to bed
Go back to bed
It isnt daybreak yet
Is tomorrow the 15th of March boy
I dont know sir
Check the calendar and come tell me
I will sir
Sir fifteen days of March have gone by
Good
Go to the gate
Somebodys knocking
I havent slept since Cassius first began to turn me against Caesar
Is he alone
Do you know them
Let them in
Oh conspiracy are you ashamed to show your face even at night when evil things are most free
If so when its day where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face
Instead hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness
Im afraid were intruding too boldly on your sleep time
Good morning Brutus
Are we bothering you
Ive been up all night
Do I know these men who are with you
This is Trebonius
Hes welcome here
This is Decius Brutus
Hes welcome too
This is Casca
This is Cinna
And this is Metellus Cimber
Theyre all welcome
What worries have kept you awake tonight
Can I have a word with you
Heres the east
Wont the dawn come from here
No
Youre both wrong
And let us swear to our resolution
No lets not swear an oath
Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim
But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women braveand I think we dothen countrymen what else could we possibly need to spur us to action
What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what theyre going to do and wont back down
And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying
Swearing is for priests cowards overly cautious men feeble old people and those longsuffering weaklings who welcome abuse
Only men whom you wouldnt trust anyway would swear oaths and for the worst reasons
Dont spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastards blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made
But what about Cicero
Should we see what he thinks
I think he will stand strong with us
Lets not leave him out
No by no means
Yes we should get his support for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions
Theyll assume that Cicero with his sound judgment ordered the actions
No dont even mention him
Hell never follow anything that other men have started
Then leave him out
Indeed hes not right for this
Good point Decius
I dont think it would be wise to let Mark Antony whom Caesar is so fond of outlive Caesar
Wed find that he was a dangerous plotter
And as you know his connections if he put them to good use might be enough to hurt us all
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesars head and then hack at his arms and legs too Caius Cassiusbecause Mark Antony is merely one of Caesars arms
Lets be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
Were all against what Caesar stands for and theres no blood in that
Oh how I wish we could oppose Caesars spirithis overblown ambitionand not hack up Caesar himself
But unfortunately Caesar has to bleed if were going to stop him
Noble friends lets kill him boldly but not with anger
Lets carve him up like a dish fit for the gods not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs
Lets be angry only long enough to do the deed and then lets act like were disgusted by what we had to do
This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful
If he loves Caesar then he can only hurt himselfby grieving and dying for Caesar
And Id be surprised if he even did that for he prefers sports fun and friends
Theres nothing to fear in him
Quiet
Count how many times the clock chimes
The clock struck three
Its time to leave
It might happen that these strange signs the unusual terror of this night and the urgings of his fortunetellers will keep him away from the Capitol today
Dont worry about that
If hes reluctant I can convince him
He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers just like unicorns can be captured in trees elephants in holes and lions with nets
When I tell him he hates flatterers he agrees just at the moment when Im flattering him the most
Let me work on him
I can put him in the right mood and Ill bring him to the Capitol
No well all go there to bring him
By eight oclock
Is that the latest we can do it
Caius Ligarius doesnt like Caesar who berated him for speaking well of Pompey
I wonder that none of you thought about getting his support
Good Metellus go to him now
He likes me and Ive given him good reason to
Just send him here and Ill persuade him
The morning is approaching
Well leave Brutus
Friends go your separate ways
But all of you remember what youve said and prove yourselves true Romans
Good gentlemen look like youre rested and happy
And so good morning to all of you
Boy
Lucius
Fast asleep
Well enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep
Thats why you sleep so soundly
Brutus my lord
Portia what are you doing awake
It isnt good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw cold morning
Its not good for your health either
You rudely snuck out of bed
And last night at dinner you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed brooding and sighing and when I asked you what was the matter you gave me a dirty look
I asked you again and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently
I still insisted on knowing what the matter was but you wouldnt answer me instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone
My dear lord tell me whats bothering you
And now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar who comes in triumph over Pompeys defeated sons
Go home
Run to your houses fall on your knees and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude
Go go good countrymen and to make up for having done wrong gather up all the poor men like yourselves lead them to the Tiber and weep into the river until it overflows its banks
You go down toward the Capitol and Ill go this way
Undress the statues if theyre decorated in honor of Caesar
Can we do that
Ill walk around and force the commoners off the streets
You do the same wherever the crowds are thick
If we take away Caesars support hell have to come back down to earth otherwise hell fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience
Im not feeling wellthats all
Youre smart though and if you were sick youd take what you needed to get better
Im doing so
Good Portia go to bed
Are you sick
And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning
Youre sick yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and diseaseinfested air make you sicker
Dont kneel noble Portia  
Youre my true and honorable wife as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart
If that were true then Id know your secret
I admit Im only a woman but nevertheless Im the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife
I admit Im only a woman but Im still a woman from a noble familyIm Catos daughter
Do you really think Im no stronger than the rest of my sex with such a father and such a husband
Tell me your secrets
I wont betray them
Ive proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh
If I can bear that pain then I can bear my husbands secrets
Oh gods make me worthy of this noble wife
Listen
Someone knocks
Leave me quickly
Lucius whos that knocking
Heres a sick man who wants to speak with you
How I wish you felt better
Im not sick if youve prepared some honorable exploit for me
Indeed I would have such an exploit for you Ligarius if you were healthy enough to hear it
A deed that will make sick men healthy
But arent there some healthy men whom we have to make sick
That too
My dear Caius Ill explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to
Follow me then
Neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight
Calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep Help someone
Theyre murdering Caesar Whos there
My lord
Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately and bring me their interpretation of the results
I will my lord
What are you doing Caesar
Are you planning to go out
Youre not leaving the house today
I will go out
The things that threaten me have only seen my back
When they see the face of Caesar they will vanish
Caesar I never believed in omens but now they frighten me
A servant told me the nightwatchmen saw horrid sights too but different ones from what we heard and saw
A lioness gave birth in the streets and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead
Fierce fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of warranks and squadronsuntil the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol
Oh Caesar
These things are beyond anything weve seen before and Im afraid
How can we avoid what the gods want to happen
But I will go out for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky
The heavens only announce the deaths of princes
Cowards die many times before their deaths
The brave experience death only once
Of all the strange things Ive ever heard it seems most strange to me that men fear death given that death which cant be avoided will come whenever it wants
What do the priests say
They dont want you to go out today
They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldnt find its heart
The gods do this to test my bravery
Theyre saying Id be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear
So I wont
Were two lions born on the same day in the same litter and Im the older and more terrible
I will go out
Alas my lord your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom
Dont go out today
Say that its my fear that keeps you inside and not your own
Well send Mark Antony to the senate house and hell say that youre sick today
Mark Antony will say Im not well and to please you Ill stay at home
Heres Decius Brutus
Hell tell them so
Hail Caesar
Good morning worthy Caesar
Ive come to take you to the senate house
And youve come at a good time so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them I wont come today
Would I send a lie
Have I accomplished so much in battle but now Im afraid to tell some old men the truth
Decius go tell them that Caesar wont come
Most mighty Caesar give me some reason so I wont be laughed at when I tell them so
The reason is that its what I want
Im not coming
Thats enough for the senate
But for your private satisfaction because I love you Ill tell you
Calphurnia my wife is keeping me at home
She takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come and on her knee she begged me to stay home today
This dream has been interpreted all wrong
It was a good and lucky vision
Your statue spouting blood through many holes in which many smiling Romans bathed means that youll provide great Rome with sustaining blood and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood
This is what Calphurnias dream means
Youve offered an excellent interpretation
I will have when you hear the rest of what I have to say
The senate has decided to give mighty Caesar a crown today
If you send them word that you wont come they might change their minds
How foolish your fears seem now Calphurnia
Im ashamed that I yielded to them
Give me my robe because Im going
And look heres Publius come to fetch me
Good morning Caesar
Welcome Publius
Caius Ligarius I was never your enemy so much as the sickness thats made you so thin
What time is it
Caesar the clock has struck eight
I thank you all for your trouble and courtesy
And to you most noble Caesar
Im to blame for making you wait for me
Trebonius
Remember to see me today
Stay near me so Ill remember
Caesar I will
Good friends go in and have some wine with me
And well leave together like friends  
Calphurnia
Quiet
Caesars talking
Calphurnia
Im here my lord
Yes Caesar
Ill remember
When Caesar says do this it is done
Continue then and dont forget to perform all of the rituals
Caesar
Caesar beware of Brutus
Watch Cassius
Dont go near Casca
Keep an eye on Cinna
Dont trust Trebonius
Pay attention to Metellus Cimber
Decius Brutus doesnt love you
Youve wronged Caius Ligarius
These men all have one intention and its directed against Caesar
If you arent immortal watch those around you
A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy
I pray that the mighty gods defend you
Your friend      Artemidorus Ill stand here until Caesar passes by and Ill give him this as though its a petition
If you read this Caesar you might live
If not the Fates are on the side of the traitors
Boy I beg you to run to the senate house
Dont stay to answer meget going
I want you there and back again before I can even tell you what you should do there
Madam what should I do
Run to the Capitol and nothing else
And then return to you and nothing else
Yes return and tell me if your master looks well because he was sick when he left
And pay attention to what Caesar does and which men are close to him
Listen boy
Whats that noise
I dont hear anything madam
I beg you listen well
Truly madam I dont hear anything
Come here you
Where are you coming from
My own house good lady
What time is it
Around nine oclock madam
Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet
Madam not yet
Im going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol
You have some plea for Caesar dont you
Yes I do lady
If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me Ill try to get him to do whats good for him
Why do you know of any harm intended toward him
Nothing that I know for sure but a lot that Im afraid might happen
Good morning to you
The street is narrow here
The crowd that follows Caesar at his heelssenators justices common petitionerswill suffocate a feeble man almost to death
Ill move to a more open place and there speak to great Caesar as he walks past
I must go in 
Yes Caesar but its not gone yet
Oh Caesar read mine first for my petition affects you more directly
Read it great Caesar
Whatever pertains to myself I will deal with last
Dont delay Caesar
Read it instantly
What is the man insane    
You have weapons
Whats going on here
Stop it I order you
The next person to strike again dies
Whats going on here
These are the messengers from my sister and the king
What are you fighting about
Tell me
Im out of breath sir
A tailor made you
Thats an odd thing to say
How can a tailor make a person
Definitely a tailor sir
A sculptor or a painter couldnt have screwed him up as bad as that even as an apprentice
But tell me what youre fighting about
Calm down
Dont you have any manners you savage
Yes sir but not when Im enraged
Why are you enraged
Are you laughing at what I say as if I were a fool
Are you insane old man
Why are you calling him a jerk
What did he do to you
I dont like his face
But maybe you dont like mine or his or hers either
This is a guy whos been praised for his honest bluntness and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words
No flattery for him no sir
Hes honest hes got to speak the truth
If people take what he says fine
If not hes got truth on his side
Dearest kindest most honorable sir may I say with your esteemed approval which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sungod Phoebus that What do you mean by that
I tried to stop speaking plainly since you dislike plain speech so much
Sir I know Im not a flatterer
I never offended him at all
These cowards manage to make fools of brave men
Dont put me in the stocks
I serve the king who sent me here
If you put me in the stocks youll insult him both as a king and as a man
Bring out the stocks
I swear on my life and honor hell sit here in the stocks until noon
Only until noon my lord
No the whole day and all night too
Maam you wouldnt treat me like this if I were your fathers dog
But since youre his scoundrel servant I will
This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us aboutCome on bring in the stocks now
I beg you not to do this my lord
Hes done wrong and his master the king will punish him for it
The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated
Ill take responsibility for that
My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her ordersPut his legs in the stocks
Im sorry my friend
Ill try talking to him again
Please dont sir
Even good men have bad luck
Have a good morning
Its wrong for the duke to do this
The king will be angry with him
honor you
Hopefully when I get married Ill give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty
Im sure Ill never get married in the way my sisters say theyre married loving their father only
But do you mean what youre saying
Yes my lord
So young and so cruel
So young my lord and honest
Then thats the way itll be
The truth will be all the inheritance you get
Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you exdaughter of mine
But sir Be quiet Kent
I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree
Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout waiting to capture me
Ill smear my face with filth put on a loincloth make my hair matted and tangled and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing
Well at least thats something
As Edgar Im nothing at all
Its strange that Regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger
According to what I heard they had no travel plans as of last night
Whats this
Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself
No my lord
Ha ha
Thats a nasty garter belt
You tie up horses by their heads dogs and bears by their necks monkeys by their waists and humans by their legs
Your daughter and soninlaw
No
Yes
No no they wouldnt
Yes they have
By the god Jupiter above I swear No By Jupiters wife Juno I swear Yes They wouldnt dare
They couldnt they wouldnt
Its worse than murder to humiliate a kings messenger like this
My lord when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter
He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams
Thats why your daughter and soninlaw are punishing me shamefully
Fathers who wear rags Make their children neglect them
But fathers who are rich Make their children kind
Lady Luck is a fickle whore And never gives the poor a break
But despite all this your daughters will give you a lot of moneyor do I mean painin the coming year
I feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart
Inside sir with the earl
Dont follow me
Stay here
You didnt do anything else to earn this punishment
Nothing
Tell me why did the king arrive with such a small entourage
If theyd put you in the stocks for asking that question you wouldve deserved it
Why Fool
You need to learn what ants know well about wintertheres no point in slaving away if theres no hope for profit
Everyone can see that and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now
When you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill you shouldnt try to hold on to it or itll break your neck
But if you see a wheel going uphill latch on for the ride
And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did give me my advice back again
I only want idiots following my advice the advice of a fool
The gentleman who serves you only for profit And is only superficially loyal to you Will take off when it starts to rain And leave you alone in the storm
But Ill linger
The fool will stay
And let the wise man run away
Where did you learn that song Fool
Not in the stocks fool
How can they refuse to speak with me
Theyre playing with me
These are tricks
This is rebellion
My dear lord you know how passionately stubborn the duke is
Damn it all to hell
Passionately
What passion
Gloucester Gloucester I want to speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife
My lord I informed them as much
Informed them
Do you understand what Im saying man
Yes my lord
The king wants to speak with Cornwall
Did you inform them of that
This is unbelievable
Passionate
The passionate duke
Tell the hotheaded duke that I… But no not yet
Maybe hes not feeling well
I just want everything to be all right between you
Oh my heart my heart is rising into my throat
Stay down heart
Thats right uncle talk to your heart like the  Good morning to you both
Hail to your majesty
Im glad to see your highness
I believe you are Regan
You know why I think so
My dear Regan your sisters not worth anything
Oh Regan shes torn me apart with unkindness like a vulture right here 
Calm down sir please
How do you mean
I cant believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way
If she restrained your rowdy knights she had such a good reason that you cant blame her for it
I curse her
Sir youre old
Your life is stretched to its limit
You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do whats good for you
Please go back to Gonerils house
Admit you were wrong
Apologize
No more please
These are ugly antics
Go back to my sisters
Shush sir please
I hope lightning strikes her in the eyes
I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion
Oh dear gods
Thats how youll talk about me when youre in this mood
Her eyes are vicious but yours are comforting
You havent forgotten the half of a kingdom I gave you
Sir lets get to the point
Get out of my sightI guess if she doesnt love her father then Ill only have peace when Im deadCall the King of France
Call the Duke of Burgundy
If she wants to be proud or honest as she calls it she can just marry her own pride
King Lear Ive always honored you as king loved you as my father obeyed you as my master and thanked you in my prayers Im furious and ready to snap
Let your anger fall on me then even if its sharpness pierces my heart
Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad
What are you doing old man
When powerful kings cave in to flatterers do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it
When a majestic king starts acting silly then its my duty to be blunt
Whats that trumpet
I know it
Shell be here soon just like her letter said
This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works forGet out of my sight scoundrel
What do you mean your highness
Who put my servant in the stocks
Regan I hope you didnt know anything about thatAh whos this
Why shouldnt she take my hand father
How exactly have I offended you
I sent him there sir but his crimes deserved a worse punishment
You
You did it
Please father since youre weak act like it
Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister
Right now Im away from home and I cant provide you with proper care
Go back with her
Go back with her
I might as well go before the King of France who took my youngest daughter without a dowry kneel before his throne and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive
Go back with her
Id rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here
As you wish sir
I beg you daughter dont make me crazy
I wont bother you
Well never see each other again
But youre still my child my flesh and bloodor rather youre a disease in my flesh a disease I still have to call my own
Youre a pustule a sore a tumor digesting my bloodline
But Ill stop rebuking you
I wont beg the gods to punish you or caution you to fear their judgment
Become a better
person when youre ready if youre inclined
Ill wait patiently
Meanwhile Ill stay with Regan with my hundred knights
Its not quite that simple
I wasnt expecting you and Im not ready to receive you
Please hear what Goneril is saying
Were trying to be reasonable while youre so upset and we understand that youre old and… But Goneril knows what shes doing
Yes I do
How could so many people under two masters get along under one roof
It would be hard almost impossible
Why couldnt you be attended by my servants or by Regans
Yes why not my lord
Then if theyre negligent we could control them
Now that I think about the danger of these knights if you come to stay with me please bring no more than twentyfive of them with you
I wont lodge any more than that under my roof
I gave you everything And it was about time too
I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own
Why should I now have to make do with only twentyfive
Regan is that what you said
Yes Ill say it again my lord
No more than twentyfive
Not being the worst daughter deserves some praise I guess
Hear me out my lord
Why do you need twentyfive knights or ten or even five when youre staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service
Why do you need even one
Oh dont ask me why I need them
Youre a welldressed lady
If you dressed only to stay warm you wouldnt need these gorgeous clothes youre wearingwhich dont keep you warm at all
Oh gods give me patience
You see me here gods a grieving old man as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age
If youre the ones setting my daughters against me dont let me be foolish enough to take it lying down
mans cheeks
No you monstrous hags Ill get revenge on you both that will make the whole world… I will do such thingsI dont know what Ill do exactly but itll be devastating
You expect me to cry
Well I wont
I have a good reason to cry but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cryOh Fool Ill go mad
Lets go inside
Theres going to be a storm
This is a small house
Theres no room for the old man and his followers
Its his fault that hes all worked up like this
He has to pay the price for his foolish actions
Thats what I intend to do too
Where is Gloucester
He followed the old man
Here he comes back
Wheres he going
He has called for his horse but I dont know where hes headed
Its best just to let him go
He wont listen to anyones advice
Theres hardly a bush for miles around
Oh sir impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions
Lock the doors
His attendants are desperate violent men
Im afraid of what they might encourage him to do considering the state hes in
Lock the doors my lord
Its a wild night
Regan gives good advice
Come in out of the storm
Whos there aside from this foul weather
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather very troubled
I know you
Wheres the king
Struggling with the wind and rain
Hes shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea or make the sea flood the earthhe wants to see the world return to primal chaos
He keeps tearing out his white hair which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness
Small but brave in his surroundings hes trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth
Hes running bareheaded calling for the end of the world out there on a night like this when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide
But whos with him
Nobody but the fool whos trying to soothe the wounds in the kings heart with jokes
Sir I know you and I trust you enough to share something very important with you
Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war
Now this is where you come in
Im a nobleman and I know what Im doing in assigning this job to you
Lets discuss it some more
Let me shake your hand
Do you have anything else to tell me
Rage on blow
Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned
Let quick sulfurous lightning strong enough to split enormous trees singe the white hair on my head
Let thunder flatten the spherical world crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow
Oh uncle its better to smile and flatter indoors where its dry than get soaked out here
Please uncle lets go in and ask your daughters to forgive you
This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools
Let thunder rumble
Let lightning spit fire
Let the rain spray
The rain the wind the thunder and lightning are not my daughters
Nature I dont accuse your weather of unkindness
So go ahead and have your terrifying fun
Here I am your slavea poor sick weak hated old man
Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders
On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesnt love you least
Kent if you want to stay alive stop talking
Get out of my sight
Learn to see better Lear and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice
Now I swear by Apollo… By Apollo King youre taking the names of the gods in vain
Oh you lowlife
Scum
Please stop sir
Listen to me you traitor
For there never was a pretty woman who didnt like to preen in the mirror
No Ill be patient
I wont say a word
Whos there
A wise man and a fool
Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light
It will give you some protection from this storm
They are harder than the stones the house is made of
Im starting to lose my mind
Thats true my good boyCome on take us to that hut
Ill recite a prophecy before I go
And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet
This is the prophecy that the wizard 
Oh oh Edmund I dont like this monstrous business
When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him lobby for him or support him in any way
Thats uncivilized and unnatural
Oh be quiet
Theres a feud between the two dukes
Its dangerous to talk about it
Ive locked it up in my room
The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly
Armed forces have already landed
We have to take the kings side
Ill look for him and secretly help him
You go and talk to the duke so he wont notice Im helping the king
If he asks to see me tell him Im sick and went to bed
Even if I have to dieas they threatenI have to help the king
Strange things are about to happen Edmund
Please be careful
And Ill tell him about the letter too
The young generation rises while the old one falls
Heres the hut my lord
Please go inside
The nights too rough for humans to bear
Leave me for a bit
My lord here is the entrance
Will you break my heart
Id rather break my own heart
Now please go in
You think its a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin
Its a big deal to you
But whenever you feel a larger pain the smaller one disappears
You would run away from a bear but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean youd turn around and confront the bear
When your mind is at peace your body is sensitive to the elements
But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except whats tormenting mehow ungrateful my children are
Isnt their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it
But Ill punish them thoroughly
No I wont cry any more
Imagine them locking me out on a night like this
But let it rain Ill survive
On a night like this
Oh Regan Goneril your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everythingOh if I think about that Ill go mad
I want to avoid that
No more of these thoughts
My lord please go inside here
Go inside yourself
Make yourself comfortable
This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more
But Ill go in
Go out and feel what the impoverished feel
Dont come in here uncle
Theres a spirit in here
Help me help me
Give me your hand
Whos there
A ghost a ghost
He says his names Poor Tom
Who are you moaning in the hut like that
Come out
Go away
The devils after me
The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees
Ha
Get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up
Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this
Bless your five senses
Toms chilly
Oh dode dode dode
God protect you from tornadoes evil stars and diseases
Take pity on Poor Tom who is persecuted by the devil
There… And over there… And over there
Have his daughters made him crazy like thisCouldnt you have kept something for yourself
Did you have to give them everything
If he hadnt wed all be embarrassed to look at him
Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners
He doesnt have any daughters sir
Like hell
Nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this
Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity
Im the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters
This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen
Beware of the devil
Obey your parents keep your word dont swear dont sleep with another mans wife and dont covet flashy clothes
Toms chilly
What were you before this
I loved wine and gambling and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem
The cold winds still blowing through the hawthorn tree 
Look at him
The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor naked twolegged animal like you
Let me unbutton this
Please calm down uncle
This is a nasty night to go swimming
On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old mana tiny spark in a cold body
Look here comes a walking fire
This is the devil Flibbertigibbet
He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn
And go away witch go away
How are you your highness
Who are you
What do you want
Who are you
What are your names
Calm down Smulkin you fiend
Hes called Modo and Mahu
Poor Toms chilly
Come back to my house with me
I couldnt bear to obey all of your daughters harsh orders
They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm but Ive come out here to find you and take you where theres warmth and food
First let me talk with this philosopher here
Now get out of here
I swear by Jupiter Ill never revoke this punishment
Farewell King
Here are the rulers of France and Burgundy my lord
My lord the ruler of Burgundy Ill speak to you first
Youve been competing with this king for my daughter
Let me ask you something in private
Can you blame him
His daughters want to kill him
Ah good old Kent said this would happenthat poor banished man
You say the king is losing his mind
Let me tell you my friend Im almost insane myself
I had a son whom Ive legally disowned
He tried to kill me recently very recently
I loved him as much as any father ever loved his son
What a storm
Excuse me sir Toms chilly
Stay warm
Come on lets all go inside
This way my lord
Come on my dear Greek philosopher
Ill get my revenge before I leave this house
Im afraid to think how Ill be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you
Now I realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself
How unlucky am I having to apologize for doing the right thing
Come with me to see the duchess
If this letters right youve got a lot to deal with
Right or not its made you the Earl of Gloucester
I put my trust in you
Its better here than outside
Be happy about it
Ill do what I can to make you even more comfortable
I wont be gone long
He cant bear his grief and so hes losing his mind
May God reward you for your kindness
Hes a king a king
No hes an ordinary guy who s got a gentleman for a son since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before hes achieved that distinction himself
I see Regan and Goneril in hellA thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them
The nasty devils biting my butt
Ill do it
The devil sings like a nightingale to haunt Poor Tom
The demon Hoppedance is in Toms belly crying for some fish to eat
Stop whining devil
Ive got no food to give you
Lets have the evidence
Lets give a fair verdict
There she is
Come here maam
Is your name Goneril
She cant deny it
And heres Regan whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart
Stop her
Fire
You corrupt judge why did you let her escape
Bless your heart
Look at the three little dogs Tray Blanch and Sweetheartall barking at me
Tom will chase them offGo away you mongrels
Whether you bite to kill Mastiff greyhound or ugly mutt
Hound or spaniel bitch or dog Whether your tail is short or curly Tom will make you cry and wail
With one little toss of his head He can scare you off for good
Whether your mouth is black or white Dodee deedee da
Stop
Run off go visit fairs and festivals
Poor Tom your cup is empty
Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart
Please lie down and rest a while my lord
Be quiet be quiet
Draw the curtains just like that
Well have supper in the morning
Thats right
And Ill go to bed at noon
Hes here sir but please dont bother him
Hes out of his right mind
Please get him my friend I beg you
Put
Carry your master out
Come on come on
When we see that our betters have the same problems we do we can almost forget our own misery
The person who suffers alone suffers the most
Companions in sorrow alleviate our grief
Lets go Tom
Whatever else happens tonight I hope the king escapes safely
Lurk out of sight
Hang him immediately
Gouge out his eyes
Leave him to my wrathEdmund go with my sisterinlaw
You shouldnt have to see the punishment we inflict on your father
Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately
We will do the same
Well keep the lines of communication open between us
Hello
Wheres the king
Lord Gloucester has helped him leave
Thirtyfive or thirtysix of his knights met him at the gate and together with some others theyve set off for Dover where they claim to have powerful friends
Prepare the horses for your lady
Goodbye my sweet lordGoodbye my sister
Goodbye Edmund
Go find the traitor Gloucester
Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me
Thats him
Tie up his withered old arms
What are you doing
My friends remember that youre my guests here
Dont play any nasty tricks on me
Tie him up I tell you
Your highness I want nothing more than what youve already offered
I know youll offer nothing less than that
There she is over there
I dont know what to say
So do you take her or leave her
Then leave her sir
Tie him up harderYou filthy traitor
Im not a traitor unfair lady
Tie him to this chairYoull see criminal By the gods its disgraceful for you to pull my beard
As old and whitehaired as you are and youre such a traitor
Wicked woman these white hairs youre pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrongdoing
You are my guests
This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house
What do you think youre doing
Tell us about the letters that you got from France
Get to the point since we already know the truth
And whats your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently
The ones youve sent our lunatic king to
Tell us
It came from a neutral party not from someone opposed to you
How clever of you
Clever lies
Where have you sent the king
To Dover
Why Dover
Werent you ordered on penalty of Why DoverLet him answer that question first
Im backed into a corner with nowhere to run
Why Dover
Because I didnt want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh
You left him out in the storm in the black night bareheaded a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars
And the poor old man just wept mixing his tears with the rain
If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm you wouldve told your doorman to let them in despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world
But soon Ill see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father
You wont be seeing anythingHold his chair still menIm going to put my foot on his eyes
Oh help me anyone who wants to live long
Oh so cruel
Oh dear gods
Now hes a little crooked
Ive served you since childhood but Ive never done you a better service than telling you to stop
Whats this you dog
I am willing to fight you if I must
What do you mean by all this
Come on then
I am dyingMy lord you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished
Oh
Wheres your sparkle now
Wheres my son Edmund
Wrong evil traitor
Youre appealing to a son who hates you
Hes too good to have any compassion for you
What a fool Ive been
This means Ive mistreated Edgar
He can sniff his way to Dover
Im wounded
Follow me madamThrow the blind traitor outside
And throw this dead peasant into the manure pitRegan Im bleeding
Its a bad time for such an injury
Give me your arm
If our criminal master gets off free I wont care what happens to me anymore
If she lives a long and happy life then all women may as well turn into monsters
Lets follow the old earl and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go
As a wandering lunatic he can do whatever he wants
Go ahead
Ill get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face
Heaven help him
At the bottom any change is for the better
So I welcome this wind freely
But who is this
My father led by a poor peasant
Oh life is full of surprises
We age and die because they wear us out
Ive rented land from you and your father for eighty years
Away get out of here
Leave me my friend
But you cant see where youre going sir
I dont have anywhere to go so I dont need to see
When I could see I didnt always see clearly
Its often the case that having something makes us spoiled while not having it turns out to be advantageous
If I live long enough to touch you again that would be as good as having my eyesight back
Whos that
Whos there
Is it a beggar
I was reminded of my son even though I despised my son at that time
Now I know better
Is that the naked guy
Yes my lord
But sir hes crazy
Its the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind
Do as I asked you
Or rather do what you feel like doing
Hey naked guy Poor Toms chilly
Come here man
Do you know the way to Dover
Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind
Bless you master
Yes sir
Theres a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea
Take me to the edge of it and Ill reward all your troubles with something valuable
Once Im there I wont need a guide anymore
Give me your arm
Poor Tom will take you there
Welcome my lord
Im surprised my bland husband didnt meet me on the way here
Wheres your master
But itd take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible
Enough
It wouldve been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did
You mean this is the whole problem that she is shy and hasnt said everything she means to say and doMy lord of Burgundy what do you have to say to this lady
Loves not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters
Will you marry her
She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be  
Im at your service until death
My dear Gloucester
What a manespecially compared to my husband
Edmund you deserve me to be your woman
Theres a fool sharing my bed now
Maam my masters coming
So you finally find me worthy of your attentions
Goneril you arent worth the dust the wind blows in your face
I dont trust you
You cant trust anyone who abuses her own father her flesh and blood
She will wither and come to a bad end
Oh shut up
Your words are idiotic
Bad people cant appreciate wisdom or goodness
They only like things as bad as themselves
What have you two sisters done
Youre tigers not daughters
Could my good brotherinlawa man to whom the
Coward
Shame on you warped hag
Your true demonic features are distorting your body
If I let myself do what I yearn to Id rip the flesh off your bones
But I wont attack a woman even if she is a demon
I sneeze on your manhood
What news do you bring
Gloucesters eyes
Theres justice in heaven after all
That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof
But oh poor Gloucester
Did he lose his other eye
He lost both my lordMaam this letter is from your sister and needs an immediate answer  
He was on his way here with your wife
But he isnt here now
No my lord
Yes my lord
He was the one who denounced his father
What else you do know
Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home
It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence
Whom did he leave in charge here
The marshal of France Monsieur la Far
Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered
Yes sir
She seemed to be trying to control her emotions which were overwhelming her
So she was moved by it
If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow then sorrow would be highly prized
She didnt ask anything
Actually once or twice she sighed and said father as if the word were pressing on her chest
Once she exclaimed Sisters sisters shame on you
Kent father sisters
What out in a storm in the middle of the night
I cant believe it The tears fell from her eyes like holy water
Then she ran away to grieve alone
Have you not spoken to her since then
No
Did this happen before the King of France returned home
No afterward
Why good sir
Hes too overwhelmed with shame
He remembers how unkind he was to her how he disowned her and sent her abroad how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two doghearted sisters
All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia
Oh the poor man
Have you heard about Albanys and Cornwalls troops
I have
Theyre on the march
Well sir Ill take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while
I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer
When Ive revealed my true identity youll be glad you took the time to help me out
Please come with me
Sadly its the king thats missing
They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea singing loudly wearing a crown of nettles thorns hemlock and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfieldsSend out a hundred soldiers to find him
Search high and low in every acre of the fields and bring him here for me to see him
There is a way maam
But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while
Then Ill water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow
May they relieve a sick old mans suffering
Go find those herbs for him before his madness puts his life in danger
I have news maam
The British forces are on their way here
We already knew that
Our forces are ready for them
Oh father Im taking care of your business
Thats why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears
Were not invading England out of ambition or greed but out of lovedear loveand my fathers right to his kingdom
I hope I see him and hear him again soon
Have my brotherinlaws troops been mobilized
Yes maam
Is he there in person
Yes making a big fuss
Your sisters the better soldier of the two
Lord Edmund didnt speak to your master at home
No maam
What could my sisters letter to him say
I dont know maam
He rushed away on serious business
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him
Wherever he goes he inspires compassion and people turn against us
And also to find out the size of the enemy army
I have to follow him and give him the letter
Our troops are deployed tomorrow
Stay with us tonight
Its dangerous out there
Peace to you my lord of Burgundy
Since you love money and power so much I wont be your wife
Ill take you and your wonderful virtues here and now if its okay that Im picking up what others have thrown away
No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me nowSay goodbye to them Cordelia even though theyve been unkind to you
Shes no longer my daughter and Ill never see her face again
Say goodbye to your sisters
I cant maam
My lady ordered me to deliver her letter
Why would she write to Edmund
It probably has something to do with… I dont know
Maam Id rather I know your lady Goneril doesnt love her husband
Im sure of that
And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances
I know she trusts you and tells you everything
Me maam
I know what Im talking about
So I recommend you take note of what Im about to say
My husband is dead
Edmund and I have talked and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril
You can figure out the rest
Goodbye
When will we get to the top of that cliff
The ground feels flat to me
No its dreadfully steep
No really I dont
Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness
It may be so
It seems to me that your voice has changed and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be
Youre mistaken about all that
The only thing different about me is my clothes
I think youre more articulate
Come on sir
This is the place
Stand still
Its so scary to look down
The crows flying down below look as small as ants
Halfway down the cliff theres somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbsa risky business
That big ship over there looks no bigger
Up here you cant even hear the waves crashing against the rocks
Lead me to where youre standing
Give me your hand
Youre now within a foot of the cliffs edge
Let go of my hand
Goodbye good sir
With all my heart
Oh you mighty gods 
Gone sir
Goodbye
Go away and let me die
You just fell the height of ten ship masts straight down
Its a miracle youre alive
Say something again
But did I fall or not
You fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff
Look for yourselfsee the top of the cliff way up there
The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard
Just look
It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people
Give me your arm
Get up
How do you feel
Can you feel your legs
Youre standing
Only too well
This is beyond weird
What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell
That was a poor unlucky beggar
From down here I thought his eyes looked like full moons
He had a thousand noses and twisted horns like wave crests in a storm at sea
It was some devil
I understand now
From now on Ill put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out Enough enough and disappears
I thought that thing youre talking about was a man
Cheer up and be at peace
But who is that
Im the king himself
Lifes better at 
piece of cheese will get himI challenge you to a match
Oh that arrow was well shot
Whoosh
Sweet marjoram
Thats it
I know that voice
Ha
Goneril with a white beard
I tell you they are not honest men
They told me I was everything
I recognize something about that voice
Isnt that the king
Yes every inch a king
I pardon that man
What are you accused of
Adultery
Ill commute your death sentence
To die for adultery
No
Little birds do it and dragonflies copulate right in front of me
Lets have more sex in the world since Gloucesters bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters conceived in lawful wedlock have been to me
Get to it be lustful sleep aroundI need soldiers for my army
Women are sex machines below the waist though theyre chaste up above
Thats where hell is and darkness and fires and stench
Give me an aphrodisiac pharmacist
Theres money in it for you
Oh let me kiss his hand
Let me wipe it off first
I remember your eyes quite well
Are you squinting at me
Read it
How
With my eye sockets
Oh ho is that what youre getting at
No eyes in your head til theres money in your wallet
What are you crazy
You dont need eyes to see how the world works
Look with your ears
Look how the judge yells at a simple thief
Have you seen a farmers dog bark at a beggar
Yes sir
And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt
Thats authority
You stupid cop stop your violence
Why are you whipping that whore
You should be whipping yourself since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which youre punishing her
One criminal punishes another
You cant blame anyone for it anyone I say
Ill vouch for that
Believe me my friend since I have the power to stop the prosecutors
Harder harder
Like that  
If you want to cry over my bad luck Ill give you my eyes
I know you
Your names Gloucester
You have to be patient with me
I came here crying
The first time we see the world as newborns we cry and scream
Ill read you a sermon
Listen to this
Oh how awful
When were born we cry because weve arrived on the stage of life like all the other fools
Thats a nice hat youve got there
How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt
Ill test it out
And when Ive sneaked up on my sonsinlaw then Ill kill kill kill kill kill kill
What Im a prisoner
No rescue for me
Treat me well
Theres a ransom
I need a doctor
My brains are injured
You can have anything you want
Will no one back me up
Am I all alone
That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears
Good sir
Ill die  Youre of royal blood and we obey you
Then theres still a chance
Come and get it
But youll have to catch me
Catch me if you can
Sa sa sa sa
In a king the sight is unbearable
Hello good sir
How do you do sir
How can I help you
Have you heard any news of impending battle
Certainly
Everyone who can hear has heard about it
Could you tell me how near the enemy is
Very near and approaching fast
The main body of the army is expected here any hour now
Thank you sir
Thats all I wanted to know
I know you for what you really are but as your sister Im reluctant to criticize you
I leave him in your carebut oh if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him
Goodbye to you both
Dont tell us what our duty is
Time will tell what youve got up your sleeve
Have a good life
Come with me my dear Cordelia
Sister I have a lot to say about things that concern us both
I think that our father will leave here tonight
Yes Im sure he willto stay with you
Next month hell stay with us
Hes so flighty in his old age as we keep noticing
He has always loved Cordelia best and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious
The queen is here on special business and her army has moved on
Thank you sir
Gentle gods in heaven please let me die
Dont tempt me to suicide again
Pray well father
And who are you good sir
Im a poor man whos been humbled by many misfortunes
Thank you very much
May heaven bless you
What good luck
That blind head of yours was created to make me rich
You old traitor repent all your sins
I hope youre strong enough to do it
Whoa man you dare to support someone whos been proclaimed a traitor
Get out of here before his bad luck infects you too
Let go of his arm
Oh no sir I wont let him go sir not without a good reason
Let go of him peasant or you die
Ill knock your teeth out sir
To hell with your sword
I know you well
Youre a hardworking villain whod do anything his evil mistress wanted him to
Is he dead
Lets look in his pockets
The letters he spoke of may help me
Hes dead
Im just sorry I had to be the one to kill him
Lets see here
Come on envelope open up for me
Reading their mail isnt as bad
Dont forget the vows we made to each other
The king is insane
Itd be better to be delirious and unaware of anything
Give me your hand
I think I hear the drums far away
Come father Ill leave you at a friends house
Oh Kent what could I ever do to become as good as you are
I wont live long enough and all my efforts will fail me
Just being thanked is more than enough for me madam
I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth no more or less
Change into better clothes
Please take them off
I have to ask you as a favor not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right
All right my lordHows the king doing
Hes still sleeping maam
Would you mind if we woke up the king
Hes slept a long time
Is he in his royal garments
Yes maam
Stay close by when we wake him up maam
Im sure he will stay under control
All right
Please come closer Make the music louder please
Kind and dear princess
If you hadnt been their father your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion
And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums
Oh oh
Its a wonder you didnt lose your life and your mind all at onceHes waking up
Talk to him
You talk to him maam
Thats most appropriate
How are you my royal lord
How is your majesty doing
You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave
Even my tears burn me like molten lead
Sir do you know who I am
Youre a spirit I know
Where did you die
Let him be for a bit
Where have I been
Where am I
Is it daytime
Ive been tricked
I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition
I dont know what to say
I cant even be sure these are my hands
Lets see
I feel this pinprick
I wish I knew what is happening
Please dont make fun of me
Im a foolish senile old man eightysomething years old not an hour more or less
To put it plainly Im afraid Im not quite sane
I feel I should recognize you and that man 
I cant recall where I slept last night
Dont laugh at me but I swear I think this lady is my child Cordelia
And I am I am
Are your tears wet
Yes indeed they are
Please dont cry
If you have poison for me Ill drink it
But you didnt even though you had every reason
I had no reason no reason
Am I in France
Youre in your own kingdom sir
Dont deceive me
You can relax maam
His insane period is over
But its dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost
Ask him to go in
Dont trouble him further until his mind is more settled
Would your highness like to take a walk
Youll have to bear with me
Please forgive and forget
Im old and foolish
Is it true sir that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say
Yes its true sir
Who is leading his men
They say Gloucesters bastard son is
I hear that Edgar Gloucesters exiled son is with the Earl of Kent in Germany
You cant trust all the rumors
Its time to reassess the situation
The British troops are coming near
It will likely be a bloody fight
Goodbye sir
Im afraid that may be the case madam
Now my sweet lord you know how much I like you
Tell me truthfully do you love my sister
No
Im just worried that youve been cozying up to her and gotten intimate with her
No I swear on my honor I havent madam
Hes going senile
But then again hes never really understood his own feelings very well
Yes he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life
Now that hes old we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws which have turned into deeprooted habits but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age
Well probably witness many more outbursts from him like banishing Kent
Theres still the King of Frances farewell ceremony
Lets put our heads together
If our father continues to use his authority as usual then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us
Well have to think about it carefully
We have to strike while the irons hot
I cant stand her
Please my lord dont be friendly with her
Dont worry about meYour sister and the duke are here
Noble words sir
Why are we talking about this
Then lets meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next
Ill meet you at your tent
Goneril are you coming with us
No
Its the best thing to do
Please come with me
Wait until I read the letter
I was ordered not to
When the time comes tell the herald to blow the trumpet and Ill return
Goodbye then
Ill take a look at your letter
Prepare your troops
Well be ready when the time comes
Which one of them should I pick
Both
One
Neither
I cant enjoy either of them as long as the other ones alive
Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husbands still alive
Ill use Albanys power and authority for now to win the war but afterward one of the sisterswhichever one wants tocan get rid of him
If I ever come back Ill bring you good news
Good luck sir
We have to get out of here old man
Let me help you up
Lets go
He and his daughter are captured
Give me your hand
Come on
I cant go any further sir
Come on
And thats true too
Officers take them away
Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them
No no no no
Come on lets go to prison
The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage
When you ask for my blessing Ill get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me
In prison well outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change
Take them away
My Cordelia even the gods admire how much youve sacrificed for me
Have I hugged you yet
Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes
Wipe your eyes
Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again
Well watch them starve to death first
Come on
Come here captain
Listen
Ill do it sir
When youve finished youll be a happy man
Go immediately and do exactly as I wrote down
I cant pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse
If its work for a man Ill do it  
tody of them so I can do whats best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom
I sent the French queen with him too for the same reason
We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father
Im sorry sir but in this war I consider you a subordinate not my equal
Thats for to me to decide
Not so fast
He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him
Hed really be your proxy if he married you
Youre so infatuated with him that youre hallucinating
Are you trying to sleep with him
Nor is it up to you my lord
Yes it is you halfblood
Hang on a second
What a farce
Youve got a sword Gloucester
Blow the trumpets
Oh Im sick sick
I feel sicker and sicker
Shes not feeling well
Take her to my tent
Come here heraldLet the trumpet soundRead this out
Blow the trumpet
Again
Again
Who are you
All right then legitimate brother Edgar I have to have your lands
Look out Im on my way up
Kents been banished just like that
All this so suddenlyEdmund whats going on
Whats the news
Ive lost my name and title to a traitor
But Im as noble as my opponent
And who is that
Whos the spokesman for Edmund Earl of Gloucester
Im my own spokesman
What do you have to say to me
Heres mine
Normally I would ask you what your name is first
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heartTrumpets blow
You were tricked into fighting Gloucester
According to the laws of war you didnt have to fight a stranger
I make the laws not you
Who can prosecute me for it
Oh monstrous
Dont ask me what I know
Follow her
Shes desperate
Ive done everything you accuse me ofand more much more
Youll find out everything in due time
Its all over now and so am I  Lets forgive each other
Im no less noble than you are Edmund
If Im more noble than you youve done me wrong
My name is Edgar and Im your fathers son
The gods are fair and they use our little vices to punish us
Youre right
Thats true
Let me embrace you
I swear I never hated you or your father
I know prince
Where have you been hiding
How did you know what happened to your poor father
Listen to my little story and when its done oh my heart will break
To escape the decree condemning me
I became his guide I led him and begged for him and kept him from suicide
I neveroh what a mistakerevealed myself to him until half an hour ago when I was in my armor
But his frail heart too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness gave out
Your words have moved me and maybe itll do some good
But go on
You look like you have something more to say
If theres anything more sorrowful left to add keep it to yourself
Im almost ready to break down hearing this much
This may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness but if I went on I could outdo it
Then I heard the trumpets blow twice and left him there in a trance
But who was that man
It was Kent sir the exiled Kent who after the king treated him like an enemy of the state put on a disguise and followed his king carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave
Help help oh help
What kind of help do you need
Say something man
What is that bloody knife
Its still warm from the cut
It was just removed from from the heart ofoh shes dead
Whos dead
Speak man
Your wife sir your wife
And her sisters dead too poisoned by your wife
She confessed
I was engaged to both of them
All three of us will marry now in death
Here comes Kent
I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall
We used to think so too
But the way hes divided the kingdom recently nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more
Yes Ive been responsible for his upbringing
Ive had to acknowledge that hes my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment
Do you smell something naughty
Well I wouldnt want to undo the naughtiness since the boy turned out so well
But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one and I dont love him any more than I love my bastard
Oh is that Kent
Ive come to say farewell to my king and master
Isnt he here
What an enormous thing for us to forgetEdmund tell us wheres the king
And wheres Cordelia Do you see this Kent
Oh why is this so
Still Edmund was beloved
One of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me and then killed herself
Apparently soCover their faces
I wish I could live longer
I want to do a little good despite my evil nature
Go quicklyhurryto the castle for Ive given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed
Hurry send someone immediately
Run run oh run
Whom should we look for in the castleWhose job is it
Send something along to prove youre withdrawing the orders
Good idea
Take my sword
The captaingive it to the captain
Run as if your life depended on it
My wife and I ordered him to hang Cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair
Heaven help herGet him out of here for now
Howl howl howl howl
Oh you men are made of stone
If I were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with Id crack heaven wide open with my laments
Shes gone forever
I know how to tell when someone is alive or dead
Shes as dead as the cold ground
Let me borrow a mirror
If her breath steams up the glass then shes alive
Or just a foretaste of it
Let the world collapse around us
This feather moved because of her breath
Shes alive
If thats true it makes up for all the sorrows Ive ever known
Oh my good master
Please go away
Its noble Kent your friend
Curse you all youre all murderers and traitors
I could have saved her
Now shes gone foreverCordelia Cordelia stay a while
Ha
Its true my lords he did
Didnt I
But Im old now and suffering has weakened me
My vision is dull
Arent you Kent
Thats me
Your servant Kent
Wheres your servant 
Hes a good fellow I can tell you that much
Hes dead and rotting in the dirt now
No my lord that was me
Im the one who Ill get right on that
followed you on your sad wanderings ever since your bad luck began
Nice to see you
It was me no one else
Everything is gloomy dark and dreadful
Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair
Yes I think thats true
He doesnt know what hes saying
Edmund is dead my lord
As for me Im surrendering all my power over to him giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life
And my poor  Hes faintedMy lord my lord
Dont disturb his soul
Let it go up to heaven
Oh hes really gone
Whats amazing is how long he lasted
Carry them away
Our business now is mourning and grief 
Why are you hiding that letter
I dont have any news to report my lord
Whats that paper you were reading
Its nothing my lord
No
Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry
If it were nothing you wouldnt need to hide it
Please sir I beg you
Its a letter from my brother that I havent finished reading yet
Give me that letter sir
Now Ill offend you whether I give it to you or not
The problem is in what the letter says as far as I can tell
I hope for my brothers sake that he just wrote it to test my honor
I will have to go on a journey to death soon sir
My masters calling me
I cant say no
We must remember the gravity of this sad day
We should speak what we feel not what we ought to say
Come talk to me about this
If our father were dead youd receive half of his revenue forever and youd have my undying love      Edgar Hmm whats this a conspiracy
How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart
How did you get this letter
Who delivered it
Nobody delivered it my lord
Thats whats clever about it
It was tossed into the window of my room
Youre sure the handwriting is your brothers
If hed written nice things Id swear yes right away
But as it stands I wish I could believe it wasnt
But it is his handwriting
Its his handwriting my lord but I hope he didnt mean what he wrote
Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before
Never my lord
But Ive often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining the sons should be their fathers guardians and manage their fathers money
Oh what a villain
Thats just what he said in the letter
Evil villain
Go look for him
Ill arrest him
Horrid villain
Where is he
Im not sure my lord
Ill bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you and for no other reason
Do you think so
He cant possibly be such a monster And Im sure he isnt
toward his own father who loves him so completely
Oh God
Edmund go find him
Ill find him right away sir and carry out the business as well as I can
These recent eclipses of the sun and moon dont bode well for us
Though science can explain them away disasters still come after eclipses
Love cools off friendships break up and brothers become enemies
break out civil war erupts kings are betrayed and the bond between father and son snaps
This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction son against father
The king acts unnaturallyfather against child
Weve seen the best our age has to offer
Conspiracies fakery betrayal and disorder are all thats left until we die
Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking Edmund
You wont lose any respect
Just do it carefullyAnd to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished for the crime of telling the truth
Its strange strange
This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world when were down and outoften because of our own excesses we put all the blame on the sun the moon and the stars as if they forced us to be bad or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid
My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending and I was born under the Big Dipper so its inevitable that Im rude and oversexed
I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception
Fa sol la mi
Hello brother Edmund
What are you thinking about so seriously
How long have you believed in astrology
Come on
When was the last time you saw my father
Why last night
Did you speak to him
Yes we talked for a couple of hours
Did you leave on good terms
Did he express any dissatisfaction with you either in his words or his face
No none at all
Some villain has told lies about me
Thats what Im afraid of
I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little
In the meantime come home with me and when the time is right Ill take you to talk to him
Please go
Heres my key
If you go outside arm yourself
Arm myself
Brother Im giving you good advice
Arm yourself
Now please go
Will I hear from you soon
Ill help you through this business
A gullible father and a brother whos so innocent that he cant suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt himthese are the two fools I need for my plan to work
I know exactly how to proceed
If I cant have an estate by birthright then Ill get it by being clever
Any trick that works is good for me
Did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool
Yes maam
He constantly offends me
Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge
I wont stand for it
His knights are getting out of control and he himself reprimands us about every little detail
When he comes back from hunting Im not going to speak to him
Tell him Im sick
And if youre not as attentive in serving him as you used to be thatll be good
Ill take responsibility for it
Hes coming maam
I hear him
Be as lazy and neglectful as you like around himyou and the other servants
If he doesnt like it he can go live with my sister
That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers hes given away
I swear old fools become like babies again
Remember what Ive told you
Very well maam
And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights
Dont worry about the consequences
Tell your men as much
I want this to provoke confrontations so I can give him a piece of my mind
Ill write to my sister and tell her my plans
Now go set up for dinner
If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance then Ill be able to carry out my plan perfectly
I love my master and hell find me very hardworking
Dont make me wait for dinner even a moment
Get it ready immediately
A man sir
Whats your profession
What do you want from me
But who are you
An honest guy whos as poor as the king
If youre as poor a subject as he is a king you definitely are poor
What do you want
To work as a servant
Who do you want to work for
You
Do you know me
Authority
What work can you do
I can be discreet in honorable matters ride a horse run tell a good story badly and deliver a plain message bluntly
Im good at everything that ordinary men can do
The best thing about me is that Im hardworking
How old are you
Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason
Im fortyeight
Follow me
Youll work for me
Wheres my foolGo call my fool and have him come here
No I dont my lord
Very pleased to meet you my lord
I look forward to getting to know you better
Ill try to make myself worth your knowledge
Hes been gone for nine years and hes leaving again soon
The king is coming
Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy Gloucester
Yes my lord
You sir wheres my daughter
I beg your pardon sir What did that guy say
Call the numbskull back in here
Wheres my fool
Youd think everyone was asleep
So whats going on
Wheres that dog
He says your daughters not feeling well my lord
Why didnt the jerk come back to me when I called him
Sir he told me quite bluntly that he didnt feel like it
Didnt feel like it
My lord I dont know whats going on but it seems to me that your highness isnt being treated as politely as before
The servants the duke and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly
Huh
Do you really mean that
Please forgive me if Im mistaken my lordbut I cant keep quiet when I think youre being insulted
No youre just reminding me of something Ive also noticed
Ive felt neglected recently but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind
Ill look into it further
But wheres my fool
I havent seen him for two days
Ever since Cordelia left for France sir the fool has been depressed
Lets not talk about it
Ive noticed it myself
Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her
And you go call my fool
You there sir come here please
Who am I sir
You scoundrel
You lowlife sonofabitch
You dog you peasant
I wont be hit my lord  
Now my friendly servant thank you
Wait let me hire him tooHeres my fools cap a token of my gratitude
Well hello my good boy
How are you doing
Why Fool
Why
For standing up for this unpopular king
No if you cant adjust to political changes youll suffer for it
There take my fools cap
This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to
If you work for him youre a fool and should wear a fools capSo hows it going uncle
I wish I had two fools caps and two daughters
Why my boy
If I gave them all I own Id have two fools caps for myself
Heres mine
Ask your daughters for another one
Watch out boyremember I can whip you
A constant pain to me
Ill recite something for you guy
Yes do that
Listen up uncle
Have more than you show Speak less than you know Lend less than you owe
Its nothing
In that case its like the words of an unpaid lawyer
Why no boy
Nothing can be made out of nothing
Youre a bitter fool
Do you know the difference my boy between a bitter fool and a sweet one
No son
Tell me
Bring here The gentleman who advised you To give away your land
You can stand in his place
The sweet and bitter fool Will appear right away
The sweet fool in a fools costumethats me
The bitter one is the other onethats youLEAR Are you calling me a fool boy
Well youve given away all your other rightful titles
No
Which two crowns would those be
Well when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns
If Im telling the truth like a fool in saying all this whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish
When did you become so fond of singing boy
Ive been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power
Thats when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down            Please uncle hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie
I want to learn how to lie
If you lie boy well have you whipped
Im amazed how similar you and your daughters are
They want to whip me for telling the truth you want to whip me for lying and sometimes Im even whipped for keeping quiet
Id rather be anything besides a fool
And yet I wouldnt want to be you uncle
Here comes the owner of one piece
Whats going on daughter
Why are you frowning like that
I think youve been frowning too much recently
The man who gives away his crust and his crumbs Will discover that he needs some crumbs back    
will damage your reputation with themand under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre
However this is an extreme situation and its more important to control it than to worry about how youll look
You know uncle A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrows head off
So the candle went out and now were all in the dark
Are you my daughter
Does anyone here know who I am
Im not Lear
Where are his eyes
I dont think so
Who can tell me who I am
Youre Lears shadow
Daughters who can make you obey them  
This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks
Im asking you to understand my point of view
Since youre old and respected you should be wise
But youre keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly vulgar and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel
Theyre such oversexed gluttons that I feel like were living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace
Its shameful and we have to make some changes right away
Hell and damnation
Saddle up my horses
Call my knights together
Youre not really my daughter but I still have one daughter left
You hit my servants and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants
Youll be sorry later but itll be too late 
Ingratitude is always hideous but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster
Please sir be patient
That may be true my lord
Ah dear Nature my goddess listen to me
Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her
This land will belong to your and Albanys children foreverAnd now what does my second daughter Regan the wife of Cornwall have to say
Tell me
Dear gods in heaven whats the reason for this
And then youll see that despite what you thought Ill be as powerful as I was before
Youll see I promise you
Did you hear that
Goneril you know how much I love you but still I have to say Shush please
Come sir no moreOswald come here
A fox youve trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered If my fools cap is worth a rope to bind them
So the fool follows you
My father cant think straighta hundred knights
You may be exaggerating the risks
Thats better than exaggerating our trust
Its always better to get rid of what youre scared of than to be afraid
I know how his mind works
Ive written to my sister telling her everything hes said
If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after Ive shown how inappropriately hes behaved Here maam
Well Oswald
Have you written that letter to my sister yet
Yes maam
Take some men and horses and go to her
Add details of your own to back up what Im saying
Now go and hurry back
But people often screw things up trying to make them better
No not at all All right all right
I wont sleep until Ive delivered your letter my lord
If a mans brain were in his feet wouldnt it be susceptible to frostbite
Yes boy
Ha ha ha
Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly youll see
Even though shes as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another still… I know what I know
And what do you know boy
I know that Regan will taste just like Gonerilboth of them sour crabapples
Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a persons face
No
Why to keep the eyes on the sides so that you can see anything that you cant sniff out
I was wrong to her Do you know how an oyster makes its shell
No
Me neither
But I know why a snail carries its house on its back
Why
He cant give his house away to his daughters leaving himself without shelter
I want to forget what I am
Such a kind fatherAre my horses ready
Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready
Theres a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it
Because it doesnt have eight
Thats right
Youd make a good fool
I could take back my crown by forceWhat outrageous ingratitude
If you were my fool uncle Id have you beaten for getting old before your time
Hows that
Youre not supposed to get old until youre wise
Oh dear God dont let me go mad
Keep me balanced and sane
I dont want to go mad
Theyre ready my lord
Come on boy  
Hello Curan
Hello sir
I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight
Why is that
I dont know
You havent heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany
Not a word
You may hear about it soon
Goodbye sir
The duke will be here tonight
His arrival fits perfectly into my plan
Fast work and a little luck are all I needBrother could I have a word with you
Come down brother
Father is on the lookout
Get out of here quickly
It has leaked out that youre hiding here
You havent said anything against the Duke of Cornwall have you
Hes rushing on his way here right now and Regans with him
Think about it
I hear my father coming
Forgive me
I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword
Be convincing
Edmund wheres your wicked brother
Look sir Im bleeding
Where is the villain Edmund
He ran out that way sir when he couldnt Follow him now
Go
When he couldnt what
In short when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body cutting my arm
Bolstered by righteousness I prepared to fight and when he saw my excitementor perhaps because my shouting scared himhe ran away suddenly
Let him run far away
If he stays in this country hell be found
The Duke of Cornwall my master and patron is arriving tonight
joy except my love for you and I find that only your majestys love makes me happy
Speak
Nothing my lord
Nothing
Nothing
Come on nothing will get you nothing
Try again
I dont have a talent for putting my hearts feelings into words
I love you as a child should love her father neither more nor less
What are you saying Cordelia
Revise your statement or you may damage your inheritance
justice will be rewarded
He answered You penniless bastard
Do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours anyone would believe you
No
Id deny whatever evidence you had against meeven if it were in my own handwritingand turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery
And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldnt realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me Oh how monstrously evil
He said he would deny that he wrote his letter
The dukes trumpets
I dont know why hes come here
Ill forbid all ships from leaving our harbors
The villain wont escape
The duke will agree with me on that
How are you my friend
Ever since I arrived here just now Ive been hearing strange rumors
How are you my lord
Oh madam my old heart is broken broken
Oh my lady Im ashamed to admit it
Wasnt he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father
I dont know madam
Oh its too terrible
To answer your question maamyes he was friendly with those knights
Then its no surprise they had a bad influence on him
They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money
Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about themand warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house
And I wont be there eitherEdmund Im told youve acted like a true son to your father
I just did my duty sir
He exposed Edgars murderous plot and was wounded as you see there when trying to apprehend him
Are your men searching for him
Yes my lord
If hes caught hell never make trouble for anyone again
I need people as trustworthy as you
Ill always be loyal to you sir
You dont know why we came to visit you Yes and so unexpectedly at night
Their messengers are ready waiting to deliver our response in these matters
So please old friend give us some good advice
Im at your service madam
Both of you are very welcome here
Good morning to you friend
Do you work in this house
Yes I do
Where should we stable our horses
In the mud
Please sir be kind to me and tell me
I wont be kind to you
In that case I dont much care for you either
If I could get my hands on you Id make you care
Why are you talking to me like this
I dont even know you
Ah but I know you
Who am I then
What an ogre you are to slander someone you dont know and who doesnt know you
What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you dont know me
It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king
Draw your sword scoundrel
Ill make ground beef out of you
Get away from me
Ive got nothing to do with you
Draw your sword you jerk
You come here with letters against the king and you take his conceited daughters side against his royal highness
Draw your sword scoundrel or Ill slice your thighs like flank steak
Draw your sword
Come on
Help
Murderer
Help
Stand and fight you overdressed servant fight
Help
Murder murder
Macbeth
Then stay with us
Theres still a bit of daylight in the sky
Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns
The rest of the kings guests are already inside
Thats him
Prepare yourselves
It will rain tonight
Then let the rain come down
Oh this is treachery
Get out of here good Fleance run run run
Someday you can get revengeOh you bastard
Who put out the light
Wasnt that the best thing to do
Theres only one body here
The son ran away
We failed in half of our mission
Well lets get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish
From the highest to the lowest of you I bid you a hearty welcome
Thanks to your majesty
I will walk around and mingle with all of you playing the humble host
Say welcome to all of our friends for me sir for in my heart they are all welcome
And they respond to you with their hearts as well
The table is full on both sides
I will sit here in the middle
Be free and happy
Soon we will toast around the table
Then it must be Banquos
My lord his throat is cut
I did that to him
You are the best of the cutthroats
If you cut both their throats then you are the absolute best
Most royal sir Fleance has escaped
Now Im scared again
Otherwise I would have been perfect as solid as a piece of marble as firm as a rock as free as the air itself
Yes my good lord
Hes lying dead in a ditch with twenty deep gashes in his head any one of which would have been enough to kill him
Thanks for that
The adult snake lies in the ditch
The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening but for now he has no fangs
Get out of here
Ill talk to you again tomorrow
My royal lord youre not entertaining the guests
When you just want to eat its better to do that at home
Where have you been sister
Killing pigs
And you sister
A sailors wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them
Give me one I said
Get away from me witch the fat woman cried
How nice of you
And I will give you some more
Ill drain the life out of him
He wont catch a wink of sleep either at night or during the day
He will live as a cursed man
For eightyone weeks he will waste away in agony
Its nice of you to remind me
Why dont you have a seat your highness
His absence means hes broken his promise sir
If it pleases you your highness why dont you sit with us and grace us with your royal company
The tables full
Heres an empty seat sir
Where
What my good lord  
Gentlemen stand up
His highness is not well
Sit down worthy friends
My husband is often like this and he has been since he was a child
Please stay seated
If you pay too much attention to him youll make him angry and that will make his convulsions go on longer
Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him
Yes and a brave one who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil
Oh thats nonsense
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when youre afraid
These outbursts of yours dont even look like real fear
Theyre more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother
Shame on you
Why are you making these faces
When the vision passes youll see that youre just looking at a stool
Please just look over there
Look
Look
As sure as Im standing here I saw him
Nonsense
It used to be that when you knocked a mans brains out he would just die and that would be it
But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools
This haunting business is even stranger than murder
My worthy lord your noble friends miss your company
Too bad its spoiling our pleasure tonight
Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear an armorplated rhinoceros or a tiger from Iran
Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place
If I tremble then you can call me a little girl
Get out of here you horrible ghost you hallucination
Get out
I am a man again
Pray you sit still
Please remain seated
What things my lord
Please dont speak to him
Hes getting worse and worse
Talk makes him crazy
Good night
A kind good night to all
Gravestones have been known to move and trees to speak to bring guilty men to justice
Its almost morning
Did you send for him sir
Ive heard about this indirectly but I will send for him
In every one of the lords households I have a servant paid to spy for me
Tomorrow while its still early I will go see the witches
They will tell me more because Im determined to know the worst about whats going to happen
My own safety is the only important thing now
I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them
Yes lets go to sleep
My strange selfdelusions just come from inexperience
Were still just beginners when it comes to crime
Whats wrong Hecate
You look angry
Dont I have a reason to be angry you disobedient hags
But you can make it up to me
Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell
Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny
You bring your cauldrons your spells your charms and everything else
Im about to fly away
Ill spend tonight working to make something horrible happen
I have a lot to do before noon
An important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon
Ill catch it before it falls to the ground
When I work it over with magic spells the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions
He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate he will mock death and he will think he is above wisdom grace and fear
As you all know overconfidence is mans greatest enemy
Listen
Im being called
Look my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me
All Im saying is that strange things have been going on
Clearly men should not go out walking too late
And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father
Those are the things we pine for now
Macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that hes preparing for war
Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland
Ill send my prayers with him
Although I cant make his ship disappear I can still make his journey miserable
Look what I have here
Show me show me
A drum a drum
Macbeth has come
The tawny cat has meowed three times
My spirit friend Harpier is yelling Its time its time Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Well cool the mixture with baboon blood
Well done
I admire your efforts and all of you will share the rewards
Now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies enchanting everything you put in
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs
Doors open up for whoever is knocking
Whats going on here you secret evil midnight hags
What are you doing
Something there isnt a word for
Tell me what I want to know
Speak
Demand
Well answer
Would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our masters
Call them
Let me see them
Pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring
Tell me you unknown power He can read your thoughts
Listen but dont speak
Macbeth
Macbeth
Macbeth
Beware Macduff
Beware the thane of Fife
Let me go
Enough
Whatever you are thanks for your advice
You have guessed exactly what I feared
But one word more He will not be commanded by you
Heres another stronger than the first
Macbeth
If I had three ears Id listen with all three
Be violent bold and firm
Laugh at the power of other men because nobody born from a woman will ever harm Macbeth  
But even so Ill make doubly sure
That way I can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night
What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head
Listen but dont speak to it
Be brave like the lion and proud
Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight you at Dunsinane Hill
That will never happen
Who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth
These were sweet omens
Good
My murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of Birnam gets up and moves and I will be king for my entire natural life
But my heart is still throbbing to know one thing
Tell me if your dark powers can see this far will Banquos sons ever reign in this kingdom
Dont try to find out more
I demand to be satisfied
If you refuse let an eternal curse fall on you
Let me know
Why is that cauldron sinking
And what is that music
Show
Show
Show
Show him and make him grieve
Come like shadows and depart in the same way
You look too much like the ghost of Banquo
Go away     
What
Is this true
Come sisters lets cheer him up and show him our talents
Where are they
Gone
Let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed
What does your grace want
Did you see the weird sisters
No my lord
Didnt they pass by you
No indeed my lord
I heard the galloping of horses
Who was it that came here
Two or three men my lord who brought the message that Macduff has fled to England
Fled to England
Yes my good lord
Time you thwart my dreadful plans
No more foolish talk
I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose
But no more spooky visionsWhere are the messengers
Come bring me to them
What did he do that made him flee this land
You have to be patient madam
He had no patience
He was crazy to run away
Even if youre not a traitor youre going to look like one if you run away
You dont know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee
How could it be wisdom
To leave his wife his children his house and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it
Even the fragile wren the smallest of birds will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest
His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love
My dearest relative Im begging you pull yourself together
As for your husband he is noble wise and judicious and he understands what the times require
Ill say goodbye now
It wont be long before Im back
When things are at their worst they have to stop or else improve to the way things were before
He has a father and yet he is fatherless
If I stay longer Ill embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying
Im leaving now
Young man your fathers dead
What are you going to do now
How are you going to live
What
Are you going to start eating worms and flies
I mean I will live on whatever I get like birds do
Youd be a pitiful bird
You wouldnt know enough to be afraid of traps
No matter what you say my father is not dead
Yes he is dead
What are you going to do for a father
Maybe you should ask what will you do for a husband
Oh I can buy twenty husbands at any market
Speak if you can
All hail Macbeth
Hail to you thane of Glamis
All hail Macbeth
Hail
Hail
Hail
You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater
You are not as happy as Macbeth yet much happier
Your descendants will be kings even though you will not be one
So all hail Macbeth and Banquo
If so youd be buying them to sell again
You talk like a child but youre very smart anyway
Was my father a traitor Mother
Yes he was
What is a traitor
Someone who makes a promise and breaks it
And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged
And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged
Everyone
Who should hang them
The honest men
Then the liars are fools for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them
If he were dead youd be weeping for him
If you arent weeping its a good sign that Ill soon have a new father
Silly babbler how you talk
Bless you fair lady
You dont know me but I know youre an important person
Im afraid something dangerous is coming toward you
If youll take a simple mans advice dont be here when it arrives
Go away and take your children
I feel bad for scaring you like this but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm
And harm is getting close
Heaven keep you safe
Where should I go
I havent done anything wrong
But I have to remember that Im here on Earth where doing evil is often praised and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake
So then why should I offer this womanish defense that Im innocent
Who are these men
Where is your husband
I hope hes not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him
Hes a traitor
Youre lying you shaggyhaired villain
Whats that you runt
He has killed me Mother
Run away I beg you
Lets seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out
Instead of crying lets keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men
Each day new widows howl new orphans cry and new sorrows slap heaven in the face until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotlands anguish and screams in pain
What you just said may perhaps be true
This tyrant whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it was once considered an honest man
You were one of his favorites
He hasnt done anything to harm you yet
It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth
I am not treacherous
But Macbeth is
Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command
But I beg your pardon
My fears cant actually make you evil
Angels are still bright even though Lucifer the brightest angel fell from heaven
Even though everything evil wants to look good good still has to look good too
Why did you leave your wife and child vulnerablethe most precious things in your life those strong bonds of love
But I beg you dont interpret my suspicions as slander against you
You may really be honest no matter what I think
Bleed bleed poor country
I wouldnt be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeths kingdom and the riches of the East too
Dont be offended
I dont completely distrust you
I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeths oppression
Our country weeps it bleeds and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds
The English have promised me thousands of troops
Who are you talking about
Even in hell you couldnt find a devil worse than Macbeth
I admit that hes murderous lecherous greedy lying deceitful violent malicious and guilty of every sin that has a name
But there is no end absolutely none to my sexual desires
Your wives your daughters your old women and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust
It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me
Endless greed and lust in a mans nature is a kind of tyranny
It has caused the downfall of many kings
But dont be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you
There are more than enough willing women around
Greed has been the downfall of many kings
But I dont have any good sides
No if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell
Oh Scotland Scotland
If someone like me is fit to be king let me know
Im still a virgin
Indeed before you arrived here old Siward with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle was making his way here
Why are you silent
Its hard to make sense of such different stories
Well well speak more soon
Yes sir
Their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine but when he touches them they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven
Thank you doctor
What disease is he talking about
Its called the evil
Edwards healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England
Along with this strange power he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities
Whos that coming over here
By his dress I can tell hes my countryman but I dont recognize him
My noble kinsman welcome
Hello sir
Is Scotland the same as when I left it
Alas our poor country
Its too frightened to look at itself
Oh your report is too poetic but it sounds so true
Banquo and Macbeth all hail
Stay and tell me more
Tell me where you learned these strange things and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting
Speak I command you
The earth has bubbles just like the water and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth
Where did they disappear to
I wish they had stayed
Were these things were talking about really here
Or are we both on drugs
Your children will be kings
You will be the king
Isnt that what they said
Thats exactly what they said
Whos this
How is my wife
Shes well
And all my children
Theyre well too
Whats the news
Now is the time when we need your help
Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers
I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own
What is this news about
If its for me dont keep it from me
Let me have it now
I think I can guess what youre about to say
Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered
Merciful heaven
They killed my children too
They killed your wife your children your servants anyone they could find
And I had to be away
My wife was killed too
I said she was
Take comfort
He doesnt have children
All my pretty little children
Did you say all
Oh that bird from hell
All of them
What all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop
Fight it like a man
I cant help remembering the things that were most precious to me
Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help
Sinful Macduff they were killed because of you
As wicked as I am they were slaughtered because of me not because of anything they did
May God give their souls rest
Let this anger sharpen your sword
Transform your grief into anger
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them
But gentle heavens dont keep me waiting
Bring me face to face with Macbeth that devil of Scotland
Put him within the reach of my sword and if he escapes may heaven forgive him as well
Now you sound like a man
Come on lets go see King Edward
The army is ready
Macbeth is ripe for the picking
Cheer up as much as you can
Ive stayed up with you for two nights now and I havent seen any evidence of what you were talking about
When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking
Since Macbeth went to war I have seen her rise from her bed put on her nightgown unlock her closet take out some paper fold it write on it read it seal it up and then return to bed remaining asleep the entire time
When she is like this besides walking and performing various activities have you heard her say anything
She says something sir but I will not repeat it to you
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else because there was no one else to witness her speech
Look here she comes
This is exactly how she always looks andI swear itshe is fast asleep
Watch her
How did she get that candle
It stands by her bedside
She always has to have a light next to her
Those are her orders
You see her eyes are open
Yes but they dont see anything
Whats she doing now
Look how she rubs her hands
She looks like shes washing her hands
Theres still a spot here
Listen
Shes talking
Ill write down what she says so Ill remember it better
Did you hear that
The thane of Fife had a wife
Where is she nowWhat will my hands never be cleanNo more of that my lord no more of that
Youve heard something you shouldnt have
She said something she shouldnt have said Im sure of that
Heaven knows what secrets shes keeping
I still have the smell of blood on my hand
All the perfumes of Arabia couldnt make my little hand smell better
Oh oh oh
What a heavy sigh
Her heart is carrying a heavy weight
I wouldnt want a heart like hers even if you made me queen
Well well well
I hope what shes saying is well sir
This disease is beyond my medical skills
But I have known people who sleepwalked and werent guilty of anything
Wash your hands
Put on your nightgown
Is this true
To bed to bed
Theres a knocking at the gate
Will she go to bed now
Yes right away
Unnatural acts will cause  Good night good doctor
The English army is near led by Malcolm his uncle Siward and the good Macduff
They burn for revenge
Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother
He is definitely not there sir
I have a list of all the important men
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses
One thing is certain hes out of control
Who can blame him for acting crazy when inside he condemns himself for everything hes done
Lets proceed on our march to Birnam
He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway and that you werent the least bit afraid of death even as you killed everyone around you
Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him
Why are you giving me his title
I dont know whether he fought on Norways side or if he secretly aided the rebels or if he fought with both of our enemies
Dont bring me any more reports
Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane I wont be affected by fear
Whats the boy Malcolm
Wasnt he born from a woman
The spirits that know the future have told me this Dont be afraid Macbeth
No man born from a woman will ever defeat you So get out of here disloyal thanes and join the weak and decadent English
My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear
May the devil turn you black you whitefaced fool
Why do you look like a frightened goose
There are ten thousand Geese you idiot
Soldiers sir
Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face you cowardly boy
What soldiers fool
Curse you
That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well
What soldiers milkface
The English army sir
Get out of my sight
SeytonIm sick at heart when I seeSeyton come hereThis battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne
I have lived long enough
Seyton
What do you want
Is there more news
All the rumors have been confirmed
Ill fight until they hack the flesh off my bones
Give me my armor
You dont need it yet
Ill put it on anyway
Send out more cavalry
Give me my armor
She is not sick my lord but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping
Cure her of that
For that kind of relief the patient must heal herself
Medicine is for the dogs
I wont have anything to do with it
Yes my good lord
Your preparation for war sounds like something    
Kinsmen I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms
We dont doubt it
Whats the name of this forest behind us
Birnam Wood
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him
That way we can conceal how many of us there are and Macbeths spies will give him inaccurate reports
Well do it
We shouldnt make any judgments until we achieve our goal
Hang our flags on the outer walls
Everyone keeps yelling Here they come Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige
They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease
If it werent for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them we could have met them out in front of the castle man to man and beaten them back to England
Whats that noise
Its women crying my good lord
Ive almost forgotten what fear feels like
There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story
What was that cry for
The queen is dead my lord
She would have died later anyway
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Out out brief candle
Life is a story told by an idiot full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning
My gracious lord I should tell you what I saw but I dont know how to say it
Just say it
As I was standing watch on the hill I looked toward Birnam and I thought I saw the forest begin to move
Liar and slave
Punish me if its not true
Three miles from here you can see it coming a moving forest
If youre lying Ill hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger
If what you say is true you can do the same to me 
Were close enough now
Good luck
If we meet Macbeths army tonight let us be beaten if we cannot fight
They have me tied to a stake
I cant run away
Youll be afraid to hear it
No I wont even if you were one of the worst demons in hell
My names Macbeth
The devil himself couldnt say a name I hate more
No nor could the devils name be more frightening
You lie you disgusting tyrant
Ill prove with my sword that Im not scared of you
You were born from a woman
Swords dont frighten me
I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman
But this whole thing is strange
The noise is coming from over there
Tyrant show your face
Ill either fight you Macbeth or else Ill put down my sword unused
You must be over there
Come this way my lord
Our noblemen are battling bravely
Sir enter the castle
Turn around you dog from hell turn around
But go away now
I have nothing to say to you
My sword will talk for me
You are too evil for words
You might as well try to stab the air with your sword
I lead a charmed life which cant be ended by anyone born from a woman
I wont fight you
Then surrender coward and well put you in a freakshow just like they do with deformed animals
Well put a picture of you on a sign right above the words Come see the tyrant Im not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm or be taunted by the common people
Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane and Im fighting a man not of woman born Ill fight to the end
Ill put up my shield and battle you
Come on lets go at it Macduff and damn the first man who cries Stop
Enough
Macduff is missing and so is your noble son
My lord your son has paid the soldiers price death
He only lived long enough to become a man and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one he died
So hes dead
Yes and hes been carried off the field
Your grief should not be equal to his worth because then your sorrow would never end
Were his wounds on his front side
Yes on his front
Well then hes Gods soldier now
If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head I couldnt hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did
And thats all there is to it
He is worth more mourning than that and I will mourn for him
He is worth no more than that
They tell me he died well and settled his scores
With that I hope God is with him
Here comes better news
Hail king
Because thats what you are now
Look here I have Macbeths cursed head
We are free from his tyranny
Hail King of Scotland
My thanes and kinsmen I name you all earls the first earls that Scotland has ever had
So I thank you all and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone
Look at Macbethhes in a daze
Good Macbeth were ready when you are
Kind gentlemen I wont forget the trouble youve taken for me whenever I think of this day
Lets go to the king
Absolutely
Until then weve said enough 
My king they havent come back yet
But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons begged your highnesss forgiveness and repented deeply
He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died
He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage
Theres no way to read a mans mind by looking at his face
You are welcome here
With that Ill be off
My worthy Cawdor
When should the three of us meet again
Will it be in thunder lightning or rain
That will happen before sunset
Where should we meet
Well meet Macbeth there
When I tried desperately to question them further they vanished into thin air
While I stood spellbound messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me the future king
What news do you bring
The king is coming here tonight
You must be crazy to say that
He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message
Take good care of him
He brings great news
My dearest love Duncan is coming here tonight
And when is he leaving
He plans to leave tomorrow
That day will never come
Your face betrays strange feelings my lord and people will be able to read it like a book
Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes your hands and your words
You should look like an innocent flower but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower
We will speak about this further
Leave all the rest to me
This castle is in a pleasant place
The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses
The fact that this summer bird the house martin builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are
There isnt a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds havent built their hanging nests to sleep and breed
Ive noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest
Look here comes our honored hostess
Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient but I still accept it as love
Fair and noble hostess we are your guests tonight
We are your servants your highness and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal for after all we keep it in your trust and were glad to give you back whats yours
Give me your hand
Bring me to my host Macbeth
I love him dearly and I shall continue to favor him
Whenever youre ready hostess
If this business would really be finished when I did the deed then it would be best to get it over with quickly
What news do you have
He has almost finished dinner
Why did you leave the dining room
Has he asked for me
Dont you know he has
We cant go on with this plan
The king has just honored me and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before
From now on this is what Ill think of your love
Are you afraid to act the way you desire
Youre like the poor cat in the old story
If you werent a man then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this
And whatever we do we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants
May you only give birth to male children because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isnt masculine
Once we have covered the two servants with blood and used their daggers to kill wont people believe that they were the culprits
Go now and pretend to be a friendly hostess
Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false evil heart
Hows the night going boy
The moon has set
The clock hasnt struck yet
The moon sets at twelve right
I think its later than that sir
Here take my sword
The heavens are being stingy with their light
Take this too
Im tired and feeling heavy but I cant sleep
Merciful powers keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest
Give me my sword
Whos there
A friend
Youre not asleep yet sir
The kings in bed
Hes been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants
This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality
Because we were unprepared for the kings visit we werent able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to 
Who is this bloody man
Judging from his appearance I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt
This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured
Hail brave friend
Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it
The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water unable to move
My brave relative
What a worthy man
Everythings OK
I had a dream last night about the three witches
I dont think about them now
But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it if youre willing
Whenever you like
If you stick with me when the time comes there will be something in it for you
Rest easy in the meantime
Thank you sir
You do the same
Is this a dagger I see in front of me with its handle pointing toward my hand   
Im going now
Dont listen to the bell Duncan because it summons you either to heaven or to hell
The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold
The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up
Listen
Quiet
My husband
I have done the deed
Did you hear a noise
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
Didnt you say something
When
Just now
As I came down
Yes
Listen
Whos sleeping in the second chamber
Donalbain
Thats a stupid thing to say
One servant cried God bless us and the other replied Amen as if they had seen my bloody hands
Listening to their frightened voices I couldnt reply Amen when they said God bless us Dont think about it so much
But why couldnt I say Amen
I desperately needed Gods blessing but the word Amen stuck in my throat
We cant think that way about what we did
If we do itll drive us crazy
I thought I heard a voice cry Sleep no more
What are you talking about
The voice kept crying Sleep no more to everyone in the house
Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands
Why did you carry these daggers out of the room
They have to stay there
Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood
Coward
Give me the daggers
Only children are afraid of scary pictures
If Duncan bleeds Ill paint the servants faces with his blood
Where is that knocking coming from
Whats happening to me that Im frightened of every noise
I hear someone knocking at the south entry
Lets go back to our bedroom
A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt
Its so simple
Youve lost your resolve
Listen
Theres more knocking
Put on your nightgown in case someone comes and sees that were awake
Snap out of your daze
Wake Duncan with your knocking
I wish you could
Knock knock knock
Knock knock
Whos there in the other devils name
Come on in con man
Knock knock knock
Whos there
Maybe its an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for peoples clothes
Come on in tailor
You can heat your iron up in here
Knock knock
Never a moment of peace
Who are you
Ah this place is too cold to be hell
I wont pretend to be the devils porter anymore
Im coming Im coming
Please dont forget to leave me a tip
Did you go to bed so late my friend that youre having a hard time getting up now
What three things does drink make a man do
It sets you up for a fall
It persuades you and discourages you
I believe drink did all of this to you last night
Is your master awake
Our knocking woke him up
Here he comes
Good morning noble sir
Good morning to both of you
Is the king awake worthy thane
Not yet
He commanded me to wake him up early
Ive almost missed the time he requested
Ill bring you to him
I know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble but that doesnt mean its not a trouble just the same
The work we enjoy is not really work
This is the door
Ill wake him because thats my job
Is the king leaving here today
He is
He told us to arrange it
The night has been chaotic
The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping
The owl made noise all night
Some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever
It was a rough night
Im too young to remember anything like it
Oh horror horror horror
This is beyond words and beyond belief
Whats the matter
The worst thing imaginable has happened
The life
Do you mean the king
Listen to this King as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons
Didnt this frighten our captains Macbeth and Banquo
The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles or rabbits frighten a lion
To tell you the truth they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition
Your words like your wounds bring you honor
Take him to the surgeons
Who is this
He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell
Go into the bedroom and see for yourself
Dont ask me to talk about it
Go look and then do the talking yourselves
Wake up wake up
Ring the alarm bell
Murder and treason
Banquo and Donalbain Malcolm
Wake up
Shake off sleep which looks like death and look at death itself
Get up get up and look at this image of doomsday
Malcolm
Banquo
Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror
Speak up and tell me
If I repeated it to you it would kill you as soon as you heard it
Oh Banquo Banquo the king has been murdered
How horrible
What in our own house
Dear Macduff I beg you tell us you were lying and say it isnt so
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life
Everything is a sick joke
The graceful and renowned king is dead
The wine of life has been poured out and only the dregs remain
Whats wrong
You are but you dont know it yet
The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped
Your royal father is murdered
Who did it
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it
Their hands and faces were all covered with blood
So were their daggers which we found on their pillows unwiped
They stared at us in confusion
No ones life should have been entrusted to them
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them
What did you do that for
Is it possible to be wise bewildered calm furious loyal and neutral all at once
Then right next to him I saw the murderers dripping with blood their daggers rudely covered in gore
Who could have restrained himself who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it
Help me out of here quickly
Take care of the lady
Right now were shaken up by fears and doubts
Im putting myself in Gods hands and with his help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder
So will I
So will we all
Lets get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall
Agreed
What are you going to do
Lets not stay here with them
Its easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none
Im going to England
Ill go to Ireland
Well both be safer if we go separate ways
Wherever we go men will smile at us while hiding daggers
Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us
We havent yet encountered that danger and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely
Theres good reason to escape when theres no mercy to be found anymore
I can remember the past seventy years pretty well and in all that time I have seen dreadful hours and strange things
The clock says its daytime but dark night is strangling the sun
They say the horses ate each other
I saw it with my own eyes
Here comes the good Macduff
How are things going now
Cant you see for yourself
The servants Macbeth killed
They were paid to betray their master
Malcolm and Donalbain the kings two sons have run away and fled which makes them the prime suspects
Everything about this is unnatural
Then it looks like Macbeth will become king
He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be crowned
Where is Duncans body
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors where their bones are kept safe
Are you going to Scone
No cousin Im going to Fife
Well Ill go to Scone
I hope things go well there
Goodbye
Farewell old man
May Gods blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good and enemies into friends
But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead
If the witches tell the truthwhich they did about youmaybe what they said about me will come true too
But shhh
Ill shut up now
Whatever your highness commands me to do it is always my duty to do it
Are you going riding this afternoon
Yes my good lord
We would have liked to have heard your good advice which has always been serious and helpful at the council today but well wait until tomorrow
Are you riding far
Im going far enough that Ill be riding from now until dinner
Unless my horse goes faster than expected I will be back an hour or two after sunset
Dont miss our feast
My lord I wont miss it
But we can talk more about that tomorrow when well discuss matters of state that concern us both
Hurry up and get to your horse
Goodbye until you return tonight
Is Fleance going with you
Yes my good lord
Its time we hit the road
Farewell
Everybody may do as they please until seven oclock tonight
In order to make your company even more enjoyable Im going to keep to myself until suppertime
Until then God be with you
Bring them to me
Im very afraid of Banquo
He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely
Im not afraid of anyone but him
Then like prophets they named him the father to a line of kings
Whos there
God save the king
Great happiness
So now Sweno the Norwegian king wants a treaty
We told him we wouldnt even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colmes Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars
Go announce that he will be executed and tell Macbeth that Cawdors titles will be given to him
Ill get it done right away
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won
Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you
Wasnt it just yesterday that we spoke to each other
It was yesterday your highness
Well did you think about what I said
I explained how you were deceived how you were thwarted the things that were used against you who was working against you and a lot of other things that would convince even a halfwit or a crazy person to say Banquo did it You explained it all
I did that and more which brings me to the point of this second meeting
Are you so patient and forgiving that youre going to let him off the hook
Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever
We are men my lord
Just as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels mutts shaggy lapdogs swimming dogs and wolfdog crossbreeds are all dogs
Its the same with men
Now if you occupy some place in the list of men that isnt down at the very bottom tell me
Because if thats the case I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me
You both know Banquo was your enemy
Its true my lord
Well do what you want us to my lord
Though our lives   We have decided my lord
Were in
Ill call for you soon
Stay inside
The deal is closed
Banquo if your soul is going to make it to heaven tonights the night
Has Banquo left the court
Yes madam but hell be back tonight
Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes
No problem madam
If you get what you want and youre still not happy youve spent everything and gained nothing
Its better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety
Whats going on my lord
Whats done is done
We have slashed the snake but not killed it
It will heal and be as good as new and well be threatened by its fangs once again
We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace
After that nothing can hurt him furthernot weapons poison rebellion invasion or anything else
Come on relax dear
Thats exactly what Ill do my love and I hope youll do the same
You have to stop talking like this
You know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive
Thats comforting
So be cheerful
Before the bat flies through the castle and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us its nighttime a dreadful deed will be done
What are you going to do
He who chooses me will get what many men want What many men wantthat many could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy
So I wont choose what many men desire because I wont jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population
So I guess its you you silver treasure house
Tell me once more what you say
He who chooses me will get what he deserves Thats nicely putbecause whos going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves
No one should have an honor he doesnt deserve
Oh wouldnt it be great if property rank official positions and other honors were earned only by merit not by corruption
How many people who are humble now would be great then
How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants
Well let me get back to my choice
He who chooses me will get what he deserves Ill assume I deserve the very bestGive me a key for this one
You thought about it too long considering what you found there
Whats this
Ill read itIt looks so unlike Portia
The one who chooses me will get what he deserves
Didnt I deserve anything more than a fools head
Is this my prize
Dont I deserve more than this
What does this say
This box was tested in the fire seven times
Some people kiss shadows
They only feel the shadow of joy
This choice was as foolish as they are
Take whatever wife you want to bed with you Youll have a fools head forever
So go away
I came here with a fools head on my shoulders and now Im leaving with twoGoodbye sweet lady
Ill keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger
This is how the candle burned the moth
Oh these fools
When they choose they only know how to lose
You know what they say
Destiny chooses when youll die and who youll marry
Come on close the curtain Nerissa
Wheres lady Portia
Here
How can I help you sir
I havent seen such a promising candidate for your love
Please dont tell me any more
Come on Nerissa I want to go see this man whos come so courteously
So whats the news on the Rialto
But its trueI dont want to get all mushy and go on and on but the good Antonio the honest Antoniooh if I only had a title good enough to match his Come on get to the point
What are you saying
Well the point is hes lost a ship
I hope thats all he loses
Let me say amen quickly before the devil comes in and stops my prayerbecause here comes the devil disguised as a Jew
Hows it going Shylock
Whats the news among the merchants
You knewno one knew no one knew as well as you didabout my daughters plans to run away
Thats true
I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off
Shell be damned for it
Thats trueif the devils judging her
My own flesh and blood turned against me
A rebel
No
Your  I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood
But tell us did you hear anything about Antonios loss at sea
All right well see you at dinnertime
I must be one of these silent socalled wise men Gratianos talking about because he never lets me get a word in
If you hang around me for two more years youll forget the sound of your own voice
Goodbye
Thank you
Is he right
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice
You promised to tell me
Thats another bad deal Ive madea bankrupt a spendthrift who now has to hide his head on the Rialto a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants
Let him think about his own debt
He liked to call me a loan shark let him think about his debt to me
He used to lend money as a favor between Christians but now let him think about his own debt
But you wont take his flesh if he cant pay
Whats that good for
Ill use it for fish bait
Hes laughed at my losses made fun of my earnings humiliated my race thwarted my deals turned my friends against me riled up my enemiesand why
Because Im a Jew
Doesnt a Jew have eyes
Doesnt a Jew have hands bodily organs a human shape five senses feelings and passions
Doesnt a Jew eat the same food get hurt with the same weapons get sick with the same diseases get healed by the same medicine and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian
If you prick us with a pin dont we bleed
If you tickle us dont we laugh
If you poison us dont we die
And if you treat us badly wont we try to get revenge
If were like you in everything else well resemble you in that respect
If a Jew offends a Christian whats the Christians kind and gentle reaction
Revenge
Weve been looking for him everywhere
Here comes another Jew
You couldnt find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew
Hello Tubal
Any news from Genoa
Did you find my daughter
I went to many places where I heard news about her but I couldnt find her
Oh oh oh
I never felt it until nowtwo thousand ducats in that diamond and other precious precious jewels
I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels
I wish she were in her coffin here with the ducats in her coffin
You couldnt find out anything about them
Why
I dont even know how much Im spending to find them
Loss upon loss
Well other men have bad luck too
Antonio as I heard in Genoa What what what
Bad luck bad luck
Hes had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis
Thank God thank God
Is it true is it true
I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck
Thank you Tubal
Good news good news
Ha ha heard in Genoa
I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night
Oh youre sticking a dagger in me
Ill never see my gold again
Eighty ducats in one shot
Eighty ducats
I came to Venice with a number of Antonios creditors who say he wont be able to avoid going bankrupt
Im very glad about that
Ill hound him
Ill torture him
Im very glad
One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey
Damn her
Youre torturing me Tubal
That was my turquoise ring
Leah gave it to me before we were married
I wouldnt have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys
But Antonios certainly ruined
Thats true thats very true
With him out of Venice I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend moneyGo Tubal
Meet me at the synagogue
Let me choose now
I feel tortured by all this talking
Tortured 
Theyre as opposite as hot and cold
Promise me youll let me live and Ill confess the truth
All right then confess and live
Confess and love is more like it
But let me try my luck on the boxes
Go ahead then
Im locked in one of them
If you really love me youll find meNerissa and the rest of you get away from him
Play some music while he chooses
Then if he loses itll be his swan song music before the end
What music should we play then
Weve all come out to see what will happenGo Hercules
If you survive Ill live
Im more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself
Ding dong bell
How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars the god of war
Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful
A lovely cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous darkskinned beauty
So Ill have nothing to do with that gaudy gold boxits like the gold that Midas couldnt eat
Since this prize is yours Be happy with it and dont look for a new one
If youre happy with what youve won And accept this prize as your blissful destiny Then turn to where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss
A nice message
My lady with your permission this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss
And so beautiful lady Im standing here just like that wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is
You see me standing here Lord Bassanio
Though I wouldnt wish to be better for my own sake for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myselfa thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richerjust so you might value me more so my good qualities beauty possessions and friends would be more than you could calculate
Im even happier that Im not stupid and I can learn
Im happiest of all that Im yours now my lord my king and you can guide me as you wish
Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you
Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion master of these servants and queen over myself
But as of right this second all these things are yours
With this ring I give them all to you
Please let me know your plan Bassanio
As long as its honorable you can be sure that Ill let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you
Back when I was a schoolboy if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the first
By risking the second arrow Id often get both of them back
Im telling you this story for a reason
I owe you a lot and like a spoiled kid Ive lost what I owe you
But if youd be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first Ill watch your arrow more carefully this time
Just tell me what to do and Ill do it
Tell me
If you see me without it you can be confident Im dead
Now we can shout Congratulations congratulations my lord and lady My Lord Bassanio and my dear lady I wish you all the joy I can wish for
And when you get married I hope I can be married at the same time
Absolutely if you can find a wife by then
I think Ive found one already thanks to you my lord
And do you mean what youre saying Gratiano
Yes my lord
Hey if I lay down my  Welcome Lorenzo and Salerio
I do too my lord
Theyre entirely welcome
Thats true and with good reason
This letter is for you from Signor Antonio
Before I open this letter please tell me how my good friend is doing
Hes not sick my lord but hes very upset and his problems are serious
His letter will tell you how hes doing  
I wish youd won the  Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale
Some good friend of his must have died because nothing else in the world could change a man so much
What does the news only get worsePlease Bassanio Im half of you so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you
Oh Portia these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper
My darling when I gave my love to you I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veinsthat I have noble blood but no money
When I said that I told you the truth
But my dear when I said I was worth nothing I was actually braggingI shouldve said that I was worse than nothing
Have all his business ventures failed
Not even one success
Not one my lord
Anyway even if he had the money now the Jew probably wouldnt take it
Ive never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man
Hes at the dukes morning and night accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice
When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush his countrymen that hed rather have Antonios flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed
And I know that unless the law intervenes itll be bad news for poor Antonio
Is this your good friend whos in so much trouble
How much does he owe the Jew
Three thousand ducats
What thats all
Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt
Ill give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over
When its paid bring your friend back
Until you get back Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows
Put on a happy face and welcome your friends
But let me hear the letter from your friend
Dear Bassanio my ships have all been wrecked
My creditors are getting mean
My moneys almost run out
I couldnt pay my debt to the Jew on the due date
In any case do what you want
If your affection for me doesnt convince you to come dont let my letter do so Oh my darling make your arrangements and go
Since youre letting me leave Ill hurry
But I wont sleep till I get back
Jailer watch out for this one
This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest
Jailer keep an eye on him
Listen to me good Shylock
Im going to get my  Please listen to me
I want my bond
I wont listen to you
I want my bond so stop talking
I wont be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers
Dont follow me
Im not talking with you
I want my bond
Hes the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans
Leave him alone
I wont follow him around with useless pleas anymore
He wants me dead
I know the real reason
Ive often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him
Thats why he hates me
Im sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced
So go
Ive lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that Ill hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrowWell jailer lets goI hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt
Lorenzo please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back
Madam with all my heart
Ill do anything you ask
Theyll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself
So goodbye until we meet again
Goodbye Jessica
Now Balthazar youve always been honest and faithful to me and I trust you still are 
Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me
Her name is Portia
Ill meet you at the ferry
Ill go as fast as I can madam
Come on Nerissa I have many things to do that you dont even know about yet
Well see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us
Will they see us
They will Nerissa but well be disguised as men
Ill tell twenty lies like that so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago
I know a thousand immature tricks like that and Ill use them all
Why are we turning to men
What kind of question is that
Here Ill tell you my whole plan in my carriage which is waiting for us at the gate
So hurry up because we have twenty miles to cover today
Yes look its true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers
Thats why Im worried about you
Ive always been straightforward with you so now Im telling you what I think
Cheer up because I think youre going to hell
Theres only one hope for you and even thats a kind of illegitimate hope
What hope is that may I ask
You can hope your father isnt your real father
That really is an illegitimate hope
Then Id be punished for the sins of my mother
In that case Im afraid youre damned by both your father and your mother
When you avoid one trap you fall into another
Youre in trouble either way
My husband will save me
Hes made me a Christian
He was wrong to do that
There were enough Christians beforeas many of them as could stand to live near each other
All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up
If were all porkeaters we wont be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon even if weve got the money for it
Ill tell my husband what youve said Launcelot
Here he comes
Youre going to make me jealous Launcelot if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this
No you dont need to worry about us Lorenzo
Launcelot and I cant agree on anything
He says I wont get into heaven because Im a Jews daughter and he says youre irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity youre raising the price of pork
I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portias African servant
The  Its too bad theres more of the Moor than there ought to be
I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do
Thats already been done sir
Theyre all ready to eat dinner
Good Lord what a clown you are
Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once
About the table sir dinner will be served on it
As for the food it will be served in covered dishes
As for your coming in to dinner just do what you feel is right
Oh hes good at bending words around
Anyway how are you Jessica
And how do you like Lord Bassanios wife
I like her more than I can say
And if he doesnt deserve this joy on earth hell never deserve it in heaven
The poor rude world doesnt have her equal
As good a wife as she is thats how good a husband I am to you
First lets go to dinner
No let me say some good things about you while Im in the mood
No please save it for dinner conversation
Is Antonio here
Yes sir Im here
I feel sorry for you
Youve come to face a ruthless enemy an inhuman wretch incapable of pity without any feelings of mercy
They tell me youve done everything you can to talk him out of what hes doing
Im ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger
One of you go call the Jew into court here
Hes standing ready outside the door
Here he comes my lord
We all expect a nice answer from you Jew
Ive told you what I intend to do and Ive sworn by the holy Sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract
If you refuse to allow me to do so your citys charter and its freedom are endangered
Youre going to ask me why Id rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats
I wont answer that
Is that enough of an answer
What if I had a rat in my house and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated
Do you have your answer yet
Some men dont like roast pig others go crazy if they see a cat and others cant help urinating when they hear bagpipes
So to answer your question
It doesnt excuse your cruel behavior
I dont have to give you answers that you like
Does everyone kill what they dont love
What would you let a snake bite you twice  
You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart
I would choose to take my penalty
How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself when you dont give any now
Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I havent done anything wrong
Many of you own slaves whichlike your donkeys and dogs and mulesyou use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them
Should I say to you Set them free
Let them marry your children
Why are you making them work so hard
Let their beds be as soft as yours and let them eat the same food as you
No youd answer The slaves are ours And thats just how Im answering you
The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive
Its mine and Im going to get it
If you refuse me the laws of Venice have no validity
I await justice
Oh Nerissa my poor little body is tired of this great big world
But as far as I can tell people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing
The best way to be happy is to be in between
Good point and well said
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life
It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches
But thinking like this wont help me choose a husband
Isnt it a pain that I cant choose or refuse anyone Nerissa
I have the authority to dismiss this court unless Bellario comes today
Bring us the letters
Call the messenger in
Cheer up Antonio
Keep up your courage man
Ill give the Jew my flesh blood bones and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me
Im like the one sick sheep in the flock the one who deserves to die
The weakest fruit drops to the ground first so let me drop
Bassanio the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone
Have you come from Bellarios office in Padua
Yes my lord
Bellario sends his greetings    
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there
Youre sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul you cruel Jew
No metalnot even the executioners axecould ever be half as sharp as your hatred
Cant any prayers reach your heart
No none that youre smart enough to make
You make me want to agree with the philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies
Thats why your desires are wolfish bloody and ravenous
Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract youre just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud
Be quiet boy or youll lose your mind
I stand here with the law on my side
This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and welleducated legal expert
Where is he
Hes waiting nearby to find out if youll invite him in
With all my heartThree or four of you go welcome himIn the meantime Ill read Bellarios letter out loud
His name is Balthazar
I leave him to you
Did old Bellario send you here
Yes my lord
Welcome
Please have a seat
Are you familiar with the case currently before the court
Yes thoroughly
Antonio and Shylock both of you come forward
Is your name Shylock
Shylock is my name
Your case is most unusual though the Venetian law cant stop you from proceeding Yes so he says
Do you acknowledge the contract
Yes I do
Then the Jew must show you mercy
Why do I have to do that
Tell me
No one shows mercy because he has to
It just happens the way gentle rain drops on the ground
It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it
Its strongest in the strongest people
It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him
Kingly power seems most like Gods power when the king mixes mercy with justice
If you pursue it this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there
I take all responsibility for my decisions
I want the law the penalty and the fulfillment of my contract
Cant he pay back the money
If thats not enough Ill sign a contract to pay ten times that much and Ill give you my hands my head and my heart as security
Theres no power in Venice that can change an established decree
The change will be recorded as a precedent and many bad legal decisions will result
That cant happen
Please let me review the contract
Shylock theyre offering you three times the money you lent
But I made an oath an oath an oath in heaven
Should I perjure my soul by disobeying it
No not for all of Venice
And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh nearest the merchants heart to be cut off by himBut please have mercy
Take three times your money
Tell me to tear up this contract
Ill tear it up when its paid
You seem like a good judge
You know the law
I urge you to deliver your verdict
I swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind
Im sticking to the contract
I beg the court to deliver the verdict
Well then here it is you must prepare yourself for his knife
Oh good judge
Oh you excellent young man
The law fully authorizes the penalty which you have to pay according to the contract
Very true
Oh wise judge
Youre so much older than you look
Yes his chest
Nearest his heartThose are the very words
Yes
Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh
I have it ready
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds Shylock so he doesnt bleed to death
Is that called for in the contract
Not explicitly but so what
It wouldnt hurt you to be charitable
I cant find it
Its not in the contract
Not much
Im ready and waitingGive me your hand Bassanio
Goodbye
Dont be sad that this happened because of you because Lady Lucks been nicer to me than usual
Be sad only at the fact that youll lose your friendyour friend doesnt regret that he paid your debt
If the Jew cuts deep enough Ill pay it instantly with all my heart
Antonio I married a woman as dear to me as life itself
But life itself my wife and the whole world arent more valuable to me than your life is
Id give it all upyes Id sacrifice them all to this devil hereto save you
Your wife wouldnt like it if she were here to hear you make that offer
I have a wife I love
I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog Jew change his mind
Its nice youre offering to sacrifice her behind her back
Thats what you get for marrying Christian husbands
I have a daughter
The court awards it and the law authorizes it
What a righteous judge
And you have to cut this flesh from his chest
The law allows it and the court awards it
What a wise judge
Come on get ready
But wait a moment
Theres something else
This contract doesnt give you any blood at all
The words expressly specify a pound of flesh So take your penalty of a pound of flesh but if you shed one drop of Christian blood when you cut it the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property under Venetian law
Is that the law
You can see for yourself
You asked for justice so rest assured youll get more justice than you bargained for
Pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the Christian go
Here is the money
Wait
The Jew will have justice
Wait dont rush
Hes not getting anything except the penalty
So get ready to cut off the flesh
Dont shed any blood or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh
If you take more or less than exactly a pound even if its just the tiniest fraction of an ounceif the scale changes by even so much as a hair you die and all your property will be confiscated
A second DanielA Daniel Jew
Ive got you now pagan
Why is the Jew waiting
Take your penalty
Give me my money and let me go
I have it ready for you
Here it is
Your father was an extremely moral man and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds
But tell me
Well first there was the prince from Naples
Im afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith
Then theres the Count Palatine
He does nothing but frown as if he wants to say If you dont want me I dont care He doesnt even smile when he hears funny stories
If hes so sad and solemn when hes young I can only imagine how much hell cry as an old man
No Id rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men
God protect me from these two
What did you think about that French lord Monsieur le Bon
No he refused it publicly in open court
He will have only justice and his penalty
You cant have anything but the penalty to be taken at your peril Jew
Well then I hope he chokes on it
Im not staying here to argue anymore
Wait a minute Jew
The law has another hold on you
The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigners goods
The other half goes to the state
So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke
So youll be hanged at the states expense
I want you to see the difference between us so I pardon you even before you ask for a pardon
Half of your wealth goes to Antonio
The other half goes to the state
Yes the states half can be reduced but not Antonios
No go ahead and take my life
Dont pardon that
You take my house away when you take the money I need for upkeep
You take my life when you take away my means of making a living
What mercy can you show him Antonio
Nothing else for Gods sake
If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property Im happy as long as he lets me have the other half in trust to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter
Second he must make a will here in this court that leaves all his property to his soninlaw Lorenzo and his daughter when he dies
He must do this or Ill recant the pardon I just delivered
Are you satisfied Jew
What do you say
Im satisfied
Please let me go
Im not well
Send the deed after me and Ill sign it
Go but sign the deed
I should really leave right away
Im sorry you dont have timeAntonio give this gentleman a reward
We owe you love and service forever
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough
In saving you I consider myself well paid
My thoughts were never on money
I hope youll recognize me when we meet again
I wish you well
Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude not as a fee
This ring siroh no its nothing
Id be ashamed to give you this
I dont want anything but that
Now that I think about it I really want it
Theres more to this ring than its cash value
Ill give you the most expensive ring in Venice and Ill make a public announcement to help me find it
But as for this ring please excuse me
I see you like to make big offers sir
First you taught me how to beg and now I think youre teaching me how a beggar should be answered
Good sir this ring was given to me by my wife
When she put it on my finger she made me swear never to sell it give it away or lose it
Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts
If your wifes not a madwoman and you tell her how much I deserve this ring she wont stay angry at you forever if you give it to me
Well anyway goodbye
Bassanio let him have the ring
Come on you and I will go soon
Early in the morning well both rush to Belmont
Come on Antonio
Find out where the Jews house is
Give him this deed and have him sign it
Well leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back
Lorenzo will be happy with what weve done
And could you please take my servant to old Shylocks house
Ill do that    
Go hurry
You know where Ill be waiting  
The moons bright tonight
I think that on a night like this when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didnt make a sound  On a night like this  On a night like this  On a night like this 
On a night like this young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much stealing her heart with vows of love but not one vow was true
On a night like this pretty Jessica in a bad mood said outrageously wrong things about her lover and he forgave her
I hear his footsteps
Who are you coming so fast in this quiet night
A friend
A friend
What friend
Whats your name please friend
My names Stephano and Ive come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at Belmont before sunrise
Shes still at the monastery kneeling and praying for a happy marriage
Whos coming with her
No one except her maid and a holy hermit
Has my master returned yet
Hey hey
Hey
Yoohoo
Whos shouting
Hey
Have you seen Master Lorenzo
Stop hollering man
Im here
Hey
Where where
Here
Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news
My master will be here in the morning
My dear lets go inside and wait for them to arrive
But I guess it doesnt matter
We might as well call him a man since God created him
His horse is better than the Neapolitans and he frowns more than the Count Palatine
What about Falconbridge that young English baron
I have no opinion about him
He doesnt speak Latin French or Italian and you know how little English I speak
Hes greatlooking but how can you talk to someone who doesnt speak your language
He was dressed so oddly too
I think he got his jacket in Italy his tights in France his hat in Germany and his behavior everywhere
What do you think of his neighbor the Scottish lord
How beautiful the moonlights shining on this bank
Lets sit here and let the music fill our ears
Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music
Sit down Jessica
Look at the stars see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold
Wake up the moon goddess with a hymn
Get her attention and draw her home with music
Im never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music
His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld
Nobody like that should be trusted
Pay attention to the music
That light we see is coming from my hall
Look how far that little candle sends its light
Thats the way a good deed shines in a naughty world
While the moon was shining we didnt even notice the candle
Well brighter lights always dim the smaller ones
A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody
Music listen
Its your music madam from your house
Now I see that you cant call anything good except in right context
How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen
Quiet now
Look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and cant be awoken
If Im not mistaken thats Portias voice
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckooby its bad voice
Dear lady welcome home
Weve been praying for our husbands welfare
Have they come back
Go inside Nerissa
Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone
I hear his trumpet
I think this night is just like sick daylight
It only looks a little paler
It looks like a day when the sun is hidden
Ill give  Thank you darling
Id like to introduce you to my friend
This is Antonio my dearest friend
Sir welcome to our house
But action speaks louder than words so Ill cut short these polite words
What an argument already
Whats the matter
It said Love me and dont leave me How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring
You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died and that it would be buried with you
And now you claim you gave it to a judges clerk
He will if he lives long enough to become a man
Yes if a woman grows up to be a man
I didnt have the heart to say no to him
You were wrong to give away your wifes first gift so thoughtlessly a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body
I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away
And here he is
Id swear he wouldnt leave it behind or even take it off his finger for all the money in the world
To tell the truth Gratiano youre giving your wife a valid reason to get upset
If it were me Id be very upset too
Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it and deserved it too
And then his clerk who went to a lot of trouble with the writing begged for mine
Neither of them would take anything but the two rings
Which ring did you give away my lord
Not the one I gave you I hope
If I could make things better by lying Id deny it
But you see my finger doesnt have the ring on it
Its gone
My dear Portia if you knew who I gave the ring to for whose sake I gave the ring to him why I gave it to him and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldnt accept anything but the ring you wouldnt be so angry
If youd known how much that ring meant how much the woman who gave it to you is worth or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring you wouldnt have let it go
Nerissas got the right idea
Ill bet my life you gave some woman the ring
What could I say my dear
I had to send it to him
Dont let that lawyer ever come near my house
Since he has the jewel I loved which you swore youd keep forever Ill be as generous as you were to him
I wont deny him anything of mine including my own body and my husbands bed
Ill recognize him all right Im sure of it
So dont spend one night away from this house
Watch me like a hawk
If you dont if Im left alone I swear Ill have that legal expert as my bedfellow
All these quarrels are about me
Dont be upset
All these friends are my witnesses so I swear to you I swear by your beautiful eyes in which I see myself reflected Did you hear that
He sees himself in my two eyes so theres two of him
He should swear by his twofaced self and thats an oath Ill believe
No just listen to me
If you forgive my mistake I swear Ill never break an oath with you again
I lent my body once to make him rich
My God its the same one I gave the judge
I got it from him
What did you cheat on us before we deserved it
Dont be crassYou all look confused
Im speechless
Yes but the clerk will never do it unless he grows up to be a man
Madam youve given me life and given me a living too
How did you like the young German the duke of Saxonys nephew
Hes pretty awful in the morning when hes sobering up and even worse in the afternoon when hes drunk
At his best hes a little less than a man and at his worst hes little more than an animal
Ill do anything rather than marry a drunk Nerissa
You dont have to worry about any of these lords my lady
I wish them all safe trips home
Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of Montferrat here once when your father was still alive
How are you Lorenzo
My clerk has some comforting news for you too
Yes and Ill give it to him for free
Ladies youre dropping bread from the heavens to starving people
Its almost morning but Im sure youre not fully satisfied about what happened
Lets go inside and well answer all your questions truthfully
All right then
My first question for Nerissa is whether shed rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now since there are only two more hours till morning
When the day comes Ill wish it were nighttime so I could sleep with the legal experts clerk
Yes madam thats the one
He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men Ive ever seen
I remember him well and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise
Hello do you have any news
The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye madam
And theres a messenger representing a fifth one the prince of Morocco who says the prince will be here tonight
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as Ill say goodbye to the first four Id be very happy hes coming
If hes as good as a saint but is black like a devil Id rather he hear my confession than marry me
Lets go Nerissa
Three thousand ducats hmmm
Yes for three months
For three months hmmm
As I said before Antonio will guarantee the loan
If I default hell pay you
Antonio will guarantee it hmmm
Can you help me
Whats your answer
Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio will guarantee it
Your answer
Antonios a good man
Have you heard anything to the contrary
But his investments are uncertain right now
He has one ship bound for Tripoli another heading for the Indies
Whats more people at the 
But ships are just fragile boards and sailors are just men
There are rats and thieves and piratesnot to mention storms winds and rocks
But in spite of all this the man is still wealthy enough
I assure you he can
Oh yesto smell  This is Signor Antonio  
To be honest I dont know why Im so sad
Im tired of it and you say youre tired of it too
Id be peering over maps to figure out the best ports piers and waterways
Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad
Shylock are you listening
If I remember correctly I cant raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately
But so what
Tubal a wealthy Jew I know will supply me with the cash
But wait a minute
How many months do you want
Shylock although I never lend or borrow with interest Im willing to break that habit to help a friend in need
Oh yes three thousand ducats
For three months
Yes I forgotthree months 
Thats right
Thats not how I do business
When Jacob took care of his uncle Labans sheepJacob was the heir to his grandfather Abrahams birthright because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir Whats your point
Did he charge interest
Jacob didnt have any control over what happened
That your interest payments are like Jacobs sheep
But listen to me signor
An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you
Oh liars can look so honest
Three months from twelve months of the year
Let me see
The interest rate will be Well Shylock
Signor Antonio youve often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto
And all because I use my own money to make a profit
And now it looks like you need my help
All right then
You come to me saying Shylock we need money You say thateven though you spat on my beard and kicked me like youd kick a stray mutt out your front door
And now youre asking for money
What can I tell you
Shouldnt I say Does a dog have money
Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats Or should I bend down low and in a humble and submissive voice say
If youre going to lend us this money dont lend it to us as if we were your friends
Instead lend it to me as your enemy
Look at you getting all riled up
I want to be friends with you and forget all the times youve embarrassed and humiliated me
Im making a kind offerzero percent financing
That really would be kind
Ill show you how kind I am
If you dont repay me on the day we agree on in the place we name for the sum of money fixed in our contract your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like
Its a deal
Ill agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice
No you cant sign a contract like that for me
Id rather go without the money
In two monthsa month before this loan is dueI expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments
A pound of human flesh taken isnt even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef
If he agrees great
If not goodbye
And I hope you wont think badly of me
Yes Shylock Ill sign the contract and agree to its terms
Then meet me right away at the notarys
Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract and Ill go get the money for you right away
Hurry up my Jewish friend
My ships will come home a month before the money is due
I wouldnt change it except to make you think of me my darling queen
Thank you for saying that
Show me the caskets and let me try my luck
I swear by my sword which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times that I would face the meanestlooking warriors on earth
But this is bad
Think about it carefully
Let me take my chances
Lets go to the temple first
You can take your chances after dinner
Im sure Ill feel guilty if I run away from this Jew my master
Be tough says the devil and run But then my conscience hanging around my heart says very wisely to me My good friend Launcelot youre a good boy the son of an honest man really that should be the son of an honest woman since my father cheated on my mother
Anyway my conscience says Stay put Go the devil says
Dont go says my conscience
Conscience I say you give good advice Devil I say you give good advice If I listened to my conscience Id stay with the Jew my master whos a devil
But if I ran away from the Jew Id be following the advice of the devil whos the very devil himself
The devils advice is nicer
Ill run devil
Tell me to run and Ill run
Excuse me young man how do I get to the Jews residence
Young man excuse me how do I get to the Jews
Turn right at the next turn but at the following turn turn left
Oh and then at the very next turn dont turn left or right but turn down and around to the Jews house
Good heavens those are difficult directions
Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot who lives with him is still there
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot
Hes not a master sir hes just a poor mans son
His father if I do say so myself is an honest but very poor man and thank God likely to live a long time
Hes just Launcelot
Who wouldnt get sad thinking about things like that
Its obvious
No thats not it trust me
So its not my business thats making me sad
Well then you must be in love
Youre not in love either
But excuse me  Yes Im talking about Launcelot sir
Oh no
God forbid
The boy was going to support me in my old age
What am I a cane
Dont you recognize me father
Heaven help me I dont know you sir
But please tell me is my boyGod rest his soulalive or dead
You really dont recognize me father
Sir Im halfblind
I dont know you
Even if you had your eyes you still might not recognize me
It takes a wise father to know his own child
Well old man Ill tell you news of your son
Give me your blessing
Please stand up
Im sure you arent Launcelot my boy
Give me your blessing
Im Launcelot who was your boy is your son and will be your child
I cant believe youre my son
Yes youre right her name is Margery
If youre Launcelot then youre my own flesh and blood
Then Dobbins tail must be growing backward
Im sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him
Lord how youve changed
How are you and your master getting along
Ive brought him a present
How are you
My masters a total Jew
Youre giving him a present
Give him a noose to hang himself
Hes starving me to death
You can see my ribs so well you can count them
Im glad youve come father
Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio
Thank you
What do you want with me
What do you want
To work for you sir
Thats what were trying to say sir
I know who you are
You can have what you want
Father go ahead
BASSANIO Please Leonardo think about this  Ill do my best
Hes walking over there sir
Signor Bassanio
Gratiano
I have a favor to ask
Anything
Dont say no
Let me go with you to Belmont
Well if you have to go you have to go
But listen to me Gratiano
Sometimes you get a bit too wild and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude
Please try to act a little more serious or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia
Listen Signor Bassanio theres nothing to worry about
Ill carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweeteven more
If I dont do all this never trust me again
Well well see how you act
Okay but tonight doesnt count
You cant judge me based on what I do tonight  
Id rather see you having fun because we have friends coming who want to have fun
Anyway I have to say goodbye to you now
Ive got some business to take care of
Im sorry youre leaving my father like this
Its hell in our house and you helped cheer it up like a funny devil
Youll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper hell be a guest of your new master
Give him this letter
Goodbye
Im sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you
But goodbye
Its not manly to cry
Goodbye
Goodbye Launcelot
Oh God what a heinous sinner I am being ashamed to be my fathers child
But I need to remember Im related to him by blood not behavior
Oh Lorenzo if you keep your promise to me Ill end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you
No well sneak away at supper time disguise ourselves with masks at my house and come back in an hour
But we havent made any preparations
We havent even talked about wholl be our torchbearers
I think its better to call it off
Its only four oclock now
We have two hours to get ready
Launcelot whats going on
I recognize the handwriting
I bet its a love letter  
Where are you going
To invite my former boss the Jew to dine tonight with my new master the Christian
Me too
Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour
Its good were doing this
Wasnt that letter from Jessica
Some people will laugh at anything and others are so grouchy they wont even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny
Goodbye then
Youre both very precious to me
You need to leave to take care of your own business
Were available
Bassanio well say goodbye for now since youve found Antonio
Dont worry Ill be there
I have to tell you everything
Who asked you to call her
Im not asking you to call her
You always loved to tell me I couldnt do anything without being told
Did you call me
Do you need something
Ive been invited to supper Jessica
Here are my keysBut why should I go
I wasnt invited because they like me
Theyre just flattering me
But Ill go out of spite to feed off the wasteful ChristianJessica my girl watch the house
I dont feel like going
I know because I dreamed of money bags last night
Please go sir
My new master is expecting your approach
And Im expecting his reproach
And theyve been plotting things together
I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday at six in the morning four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday in the afternoon
What theres going to be a masquerade
Dont stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces
Block up my houses earsI mean the windows
Ill go ahead of you sir 
What did that gentile fool say to you hmmm
He said Goodbye madam and nothing else
The fools nice enough but hes such a huge eater and slow as a snail when he works
He sleeps all day like a cat
Anyway Jessica go inside
I might come back soon
Do as I told you
Shut the doors after you
Goodbye
If lucks with me Ill lose a father and youll lose a daughter
This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him
Hes late
Yes and thats surprising because lovers are usually early
Yes for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples whove been married forever
Thats always true
Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down
Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time
We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it
Here comes Lorenzo
Well talk about this later
My dear friends thanks for your patience
I had business that made me late
When you have to steal your own wives some day Ill wait for you just as long
Come over here
Whos in there
Who are you
Tell me so I can be sure though I swear I recognize your voice
Im Lorenzo your love
Lorenzo thats for sure and Im also sure youre my lovewho else do I love so much
And now who but you knows whether Im yours
As God is my witness you know youre mine
Here catch this box
Itll be worth your while
You have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade
What I have to hold a candle up so people can see what Im doing
Ill lock up the doors grab some more ducats and be with you right away
My God she cant be a Jew shes too nice
God Im crazy about her
Shes wise if Im judging her right
Shes beautiful if my eyes can see
And shes loyal as she has proven
And as long as shes herselfwise beautiful and faithfulshell always have a place in my heart
Ah youre hereCome on gentlemen lets go
Our masquerade mates are waiting for us
Whos there
Signor Antonio
Its nine oclock
Our friends are all waiting for you
Theres no masquerade tonight
Ive sent twenty people to look for you
Im glad
I want to head out tonight
One of them contains my picture
If you choose that one Im yours along with the picture
I wish some god could help me choose
Let me see
Ill look over the inscriptions again
What does the lead box say
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has Must give everythingfor what
For lead
Risk everything for lead
This box is too threatening
Men who risk everything hope to make profits
A golden mind doesnt bend down to choose something worthless
So I wont give or risk anything for lead
What does the silver one say
He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves As much as he deserveswait a minute there Morocco and consider your own value with a level head
What if I went no further and chose this one
But lets see once more what the gold one says He who chooses me will get what many men want Thats Portia
The whole world wants her
They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living breathing saint
Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia
The wide ocean doesnt prevent them from coming to see herthey travel across it as if it were a little stream
One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture
Could the lead one contain it
No itd be a sin to think such a low thought
Leads too crass to hold her
Is she enclosed in silver which is ten times less valuable than gold
Oh what a sinful thought
Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold
They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel but thats just engraved on the surface
You dont look well Antonio
People with too much invested in the world always get hurt
Id rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun
Ill talk to you more about this some other time
Im a foolLets go LorenzoGoodbye for now
Ill finish my lecture after dinner
Here an angels lying in a golden bedGive me the key
I will choose this one and try my chances
Damn it
Whats this
Its a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket
Ill read it aloud
All that glitters is not gold Youve often heard that said
Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface
But gilded tombs contain worms
If youd been as wise as you were bold With an old mans mature judgment You wouldnt have had to read this scroll
Portia goodbye to you
My hearts too sad for long goodbyes
Losers always leave quickly
Good riddanceClose the curtains and leaveI hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice
I saw Bassanio sail away and Gratiano went with him
Im sure Lorenzo isnt on their ship
That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints
The duke went with him to search Bassanios ship
He got there too late
The ship was already sailing
But once he got there the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola
In any case Antonio assured the duke they werent with Bassanio on his ship
Ive never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in the streets
Ran off with a Christian
Oh my Christian ducats
Justice find the girl
She has the stones on her and the ducats I know all the boys in Venice are following him yelling His stones his daughter and his ducats
I hope Antonio repays his loan on time or hell suffer for this
Thats a good point
I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel
You should tell Antonio what you hearbut dont do it suddenly because it might upset him
I saw Bassanio and Antonio say goodbye
Bassanio told him hed try to hurry back
As for the Jews contract dont let it be a factor in your plans
Then he shook Bassanios hand affectionatelyand they separated
I think he only loves life because of Bassanio
Lets go find him and cheer him up
Yes lets do that
Hurry hurry close the curtain quick
The prince of Arragon has taken his oath and hes coming to make his choice now
Look here are the boxes prince
If you choose the one that contains my picture well be married right away
But if you fail you have to leave immediately
Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules
Okay Im ready
I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for
Gold silver and common lead
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has Youd have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you
What does the golden box say
Hmm let me see
We seemed to have two separate bodies but we had one heart
Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend
Its not friendly and its not ladylike
All women would be angry with you for doing it even though Im the only one whos hurt by it
Im not insulting you
It sounds more like youre insulting me
Didnt you send Lysander as an insult to follow me around praising my eyes and my face
Havent you made your other love Demetriuswho kicked me with his foot not long agocall me a goddess and a divine rare precious heavenly creature
Why does he talk like that to a girl he cant stand
And why does Lysander deny that he loves you when he loves you so deeply
Why does it matter that Im not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love I feel is unrequited
You should pity me for that reason not hate me
I dont know what youre talking about
Oh fine
All right go ahead keep up your little game pretend to be sympathetic but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back
If you had any sense of pity or manners you wouldnt pretend to fight over me like this
But goodbye
Its partly my own fault since I followed you here
Stay lovely Helena
Listen to my excuse
My love my life my soul beautiful Helena
Thats a good one
You cant force me any more than Hermia can beg me
Your threats are no stronger than her whiningHelena I love you
I swear I do
Ill give my life for you just to prove this guy wrong when he says I dont love you
I say that I love you more than he does
If thats what you say go fight a duel with me and prove it
Lysander where are you going with all this    
Why have you gotten so rude
Your darling
Get out you darkskinned gypsy
Get out you horrible poison
Get out
Are you joking
Of course he is and so are you
Demetrius Im ready to fight you as promised
I wish we had a signed legal contract
I dont trust you
Sure I hate her but I wouldnt hurt her
I certainly did and I never wanted to see you again
So stop hoping and wondering what I mean 
Ive spelled it out for you clearly
Oh no
Oh thats very nice
You ought to be ashamed of yourself
Puppet
Why puppetOh I see where this is going
So how short am I you painted barber pole
Tell me
How short am I
Good Hermia please dont act so bitter toward me
He followed you
And I followed him because I loved him
But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me kick meeven kill me
Please let me go
You see how naïve and foolish Ive been
Well get out of here then
Whats keeping you
My stupid heart which Im leaving behind here
What youre leaving it with Lysander
No with Demetrius
Dont be afraid
She cant hurt you Helena
She was a hellcat in school
And shes fierce even though shes little
Little again
Nothing but little and short Why are you letting her insult me like this
Let me at her
How are you my loveDemetrius and Egeus come with us
I want you to do some things for our wedding and I also want to discuss something that concerns you both
Were following you not only because it is our duty but also because we want to
Whats going on my love
Why are you so pale
Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly
Probably because my cheeks roses needed rain which I could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes
Oh honey
Listen in books they say that true love always faces obstacles
Either the lovers have different social standings
Leave Hermia alone
Dont talk about Helena
Dont take Helenas side
If you continue treating Hermia so badly youll pay for it
Hermias not holding onto me anymore
Follow me if youre brave enough and well fight over Helena
Follow
No Ill walk right next to you side by side
All this fighting is because of you
Stay where you are
I dont know what to say  
Believe me King of Illusions I made a mistake
Didnt you tell me that Id be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing
So far Ive done exactly what I was supposed to doI put the love potion on an Athenians eyes
And so far Im pleased with the way things have turned out since I find all of this commotion very entertaining
As you can see these lovers are looking for a place to fight
Hurry up Robin and make the night dark and cloudy
Cover the sky with a lowhanging fog as dark as hell and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they cant run into each other
Weve got to act fast my lord of the fairies
I like the morning
I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean turning the salty green water to gold
But you should hurry anyway
Dont delay
We still have time to get all of this done before daybreak
Up and down up and down I will lead them up and down
The people fear me in the country and the town
Goblin lead them up and down
Here comes one of them now
Where are you Demetrius you arrogant bastard
Say something
Lysander say something
You coward did you run away from me
Say something
Are you behind some bush
Where are you hiding
Are you there
Hes walking ahead of me and he keeps daring me to follow him
When I reach the place hes calling from he disappears
This villain is much quicker than I am
Ill rest here
Where are you now
No youre just taunting me
Youll pay for this if I ever see you facetoface in the daylight
Go wherever you want
Oh what a long tedious exhausting night
Only three so far
Were still waiting for one more
Two of both kinds makes four
Ah here she comes angry and sad
Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this
Ill sleep here until morning
If they do fight I hope Lysander is safe
Sleep well there on the ground
Wheres Peaseblossom
Here
Scratch my head Peaseblossom
Wheres Monsieur Cobweb
Here
Dont tire yourself out monsieur
Oh and monsieur be careful not to break the honeysac
Id hate to see you drowned in honey sir
Wheres Monsieur Mustardseed
Here
Give me your first Mr Mustardseed
Please stop bowing good sir
What would you like me to do
Nothing good sir except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head
I should go to the barbers monsieur because I think Im getting really hairy around the face
And Im such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little I need to scratch
Would you like to hear some music my sweet love
I have a pretty good ear for music
Lets hear someone play the triangle and the sticks
Or tell me my sweet love what youd like to eat
Actually Id like a few pounds of grass
Id like to munch on some good dry oats
Or maybe Ive got a hankering for a bundle of hay
Theres nothing like good hay really sweet hay
I have an adventurous fairy wholl go seek out the squirrels secret stash and get you some fresh nuts
Id rather have a handful or two of dried peas
But please dont let any of your people wake me up
I really want to sleep now
Go to sleep and I will wrap my arms around you
Oh how I love you
Im so crazy about you
Welcome good Robin
Do you see this sweet sight
Now Im starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated
I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot and I scolded her and argued with her
She had put a wreath of fresh fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass
And now that I have the boy Ill undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong
And gentle Puck take this transformed asss head off of the head of that Athenian man so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do they can all go back to Athens
But first Ill release the fairy queen from the spell
Now Titania wake up my sweet queen
Theres your boyfriend sleeping right over there
How did this happen
Oh I hate looking at his face now
Be quiet for a whileRobin take off his donkey headTitania get the fairies to play some music and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before
Music
Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep
Play the musicTake my hands my queen and well lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing 
Being too old to marry someone young
Or else their guardians and advisors said no What hell to have your love life determined by someone else
Thats how intense things like love are quickly destroyed
If true lovers are always thwarted then it must be a rule of fate
Thats the right attitude
So listen Hermia
I have an aunt who is a widow whos very rich and doesnt have any children
She lives about twenty miles from Athens and she thinks of me as a son
I could marry you there gentle Hermia where the strict laws of Athens cant touch us
So heres the plan
Listen Fairy King
I can hear the lark singing
Mornings here
While were walking you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night
One of you go find the forest ranger
Unleash the dogs in the western valley
Let them go
Now go find the forest ranger
My beautiful queen well go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music
I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear
The forests the skies the mountains everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds
Id never heard such raucous music such pleasant thunder
I dont understand why theyre all here together
But tell me Egeus
Isnt today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether shell marry Demetrius
It is my lord
Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up
Good morning my friends
Valentines Day is over
Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now
Forgive us my lord
Please all of you stand up
My lord what I say may be a little confused since Im half asleep and half awake
I swear at the moment I really couldnt tell you how I ended up here
But I thinkI want to tell you the truth and now that I think about it I think this is trueI came here with Hermia
Now the only person I love and believe in and want to look at is Helena
I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia
You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here
Well talk more about this laterEgeus Im overriding your wishes
Come with us to Athens
We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast
Are you sure were awake
It seems to me like were still sleeping still dreaming
And he told us to follow him to the temple
Well then were awake
Ill call it Bottoms Dream because its so deep that it has no bottom
And Ill sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play
Or maybe to make it even more lovely Ill sing it when the heroine dies 
Have you sent anyone to Bottoms house
Has he come home yet
No ones heard from him
Im sure hes been kidnapped
If he doesnt show up the play is ruined
It wont go on
Will it
No it would be impossible
Hes quite simply the smartest workingman in Athens
Yes and the best looking too
And his voice is the paramour of sweetness
You mean paragon A  The dukes leaving the temple
Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too
If wed been able to put on our play we would have had it made
Oh that great funny guy Bottom
He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life
Six pence a day wouldve been forced on him
Ill be damned if the duke wouldnt have given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus 
And he would have deserved it too
Where are my good fellows
Bottom
Oh how wonderful to see you
Oh what a relief
Ill tell you everything exactly as it happened
Tell us Bottom
No you wont get a word out of me
All Ill tell you is that the duke has had dinner already
Now its time to get your costumes together
Meet me at the palace as soon as possible
Look over your lines again
And no one eat any onions or garlic
If we have sweetsmelling breath Im sure theyll say its a sweet play Now no more talking
Get busy go
These lovers are saying some strange things Theseus
Ill never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales
Lunatics lovers and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations
Their story is bizarre and astounding but its solid and consistent
Here come the lovers laughing happilyI wish you joy my friends
Now what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime
Where is our entertainment director
What performances have been prepared
Let me see Philostrate
Here I am Theseus
Which plays what music
How will we pass the time without some entertainment    
Keep your promise my love
Look here comes Helena
Hello beautiful Helena
Where are you going
Did you just call me beautiful
Take it back
Youre the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned
Oh youre so lucky
Your eyes are like stars and your voice is more musical than a larks song is to a shepherd in the springtime
If the world were mine Id give it all upeverything except Demetriusto be you 
The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship Thats some sharp critical satire and its not appropriate for a wedding
Short but still tedious
Thats like hot ice and strange snow
How can this drama be so many contradictory things
Its a play about ten words long which is the shortest play Ive ever heard of
In the entire play not one word is wellwritten and not one of the actors is right for his part
Its tragic because Pyramus kills himself
I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal I had tears in my eyesbut they were tears of laughter
Who are the actors
So lets see it
No my noble lord
This play isnt right for you
Ive seen the whole thing and its completely worthlessunless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lineswhich they memorized so painfullyare funny
Ill watch this play
Come on bring them in
You wont see anything like that sweetheart
He just said that theyre no good at acting
In my travels great scholars have come up to me meaning to greet me with wellrehearsed welcoming speeches and I have seen them tremble and turn pale and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences and botch their wellrehearsed tones of voice because theyre so nervous and then break off abruptly at the end without actually welcoming me
Therefore love and tonguetied simplicity can say the most even when theyre saying the least in my opinion
Your grace the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready
Let him come forward
If we happen to offend you its because we want to
We dont want you to think we came here to offend you except that we want to offend you with our good intentions
Please keep in mind were only here out of spite
We dont come here with the intention of making you happy
Were absolutely not here to delight you
By watching their show youll find out everything youre likely to know
This guy doesnt pay much attention to punctuation
He rode that prologue like a wild horse
He didnt know how to stop it
The moral of this story is that its not enough to speak you have to speak grammatically
His speech was like a tangled chain
Whos next  
I wonder if the lions going to talk
It wouldnt surprise me my lord
Can you imagine cement and stone talking better
Its the smartest partition Ive ever heard speak my lord
Pyramus is coming up to the wall
Be quiet  
Im afraid my Thisbe has forgotten her promiseAnd you oh Wall oh sweet oh lovely Wall you stand between her fathers property and mine you Wall oh Wall oh sweet and lovely Wall
God bless you for doing this
But whats this I see
I dont see any Thisbe
Oh wicked wall through which I dont see any happiness
Damn your stones for disappointing me like this
Since the wall is conscious it should curse back at him
I see a voice
Ill go to the hole to see if I can hear my Thisbes face
Thisbe
You are my love my love I think
Im your love no matter what you think
Will you meet me right away at Ninnys grave
Neither death nor life will stop me from coming
I Wall have done my part
Now that Im done Wall can go away
This is the silliest thing Ive ever seen
The best plays are still only illusions and the worst are just as good if you just use your imagination to fill them in
In that case its your imagination thats interesting not the play
Look here come two noble animals a man and a lion
Ah its a sensitive animal with a good conscience
Hes as brave as a fox
True
And as wise as a goose
Oh thats not true my lord
Hes not brave enough to be wise
Hes not wise enough to be brave
Anyway he is what he is
Lets listen to the moon
This lantern represents the moon
I myself am playing the man in the moon Well then thats the biggest mistake of all
The man should be inside the lantern
How else is he the man in the moon
He cant go in there because of the candle
Its too hot
Im tired of this moon
Go ahead Moon
All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon Im the man in the moon this thornbush is my thornbush and this dog is my dog
Well all of these should be in the lantern because theyre all in the moon
But be quiet here comes Thisbe
This is old Ninnys tomb
But where is my love
Good roaring Lion
Good running Thisbe
Good shining MoonReally the Moon shines very well
Thats good Lion
Oh teach me how you look the way you do and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you
I frown at him but he still loves me
Oh if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns
I curse him but he loves me
If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection
The more I hate him the more he follows me around
The more I love him the more he hates me
Its not my fault he acts like that Helena
Thats true its your beautys fault
I wish I had a fault like that
Dont worry
He wont see my face ever again
Lysander and I are running away from here
Before I saw Lysander Athens seemed like paradise to me
But Lysanders so attractive that hes turned heaven into hell
Helena well tell you about our secret plan
Tomorrow night when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light the time of night that always hides runaway lovers we plan to sneak out of Athens  
And then Pyramus showed up
So the lion disappeared
Sweet Moon I thank you for your sunny beams
But look poor me what a terrible tragedy is here
Eyes do you see
How can it be
Oh dainty duck
Oh dear
Oh Fate come and cut the thread of my life
Conquer crush conclude and kill
Oh Mother Nature why did you create lions
And so Im dying
Okay now Im dead
Now die die die die die
With a doctors help he might recover and become an ass again
I dont think a ridiculous Pyramus like that one deserves much moaning
I hope she keeps it short
Look shes spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers
And now shell start moaning of course Are you asleep my love
What are you dead my dove
Oh Pyramus get up
Speak speak
Cant you talk
Dead dead
The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes
Your lilywhite lips your cherryred nose and your buttercupyellow cheeks are gone gone forever
Lovers moan and weep
His eyes were as green as leeks
Oh Fate come come to me with hands as pale as milk
Soak your hands in blood and gore since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors
Tongue do not speak
Come trusty sword
Come blade drench my breast with blood
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead
Yes and Wall too
No epilogue please
Never apologizewhen the actors are all dead no one can be blamed
As a matter of fact if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbes belt it would have been a very good tragedy
Its a good tragedy very well done
But come on lets see you do your dance
Forget your epilogue
The clock has chimed midnight
Lovers its time to go to bed
Its almost fairy time
Dear friends lets go to bed
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house
First rehearse your song from memory and make sure each note is pretty
Well all join hands and sing and bless this place with our fairy grace    
If you forgive us well make everything all right
Im an honest Puck and I swear that if were lucky enough not to get hissed at well make it up to you soon
If not then Im a liar
So good night to everyone
Give me some applause if were friends and Robin will make everything up to you
From then on well turn our backs on Athens
Well look for new friends and keep the company of strangers
Goodbye old friend
We need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow
I will my Hermia
Goodbye Helena
I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him
But so what
Demetrius doesnt think so and thats all that matters
He refuses to admit what everyone else knows
Love can make worthless things beautiful
When were in love we dont see with our eyes but with our minds
Thats why paintings of Cupid the god of love always show him as blind
And love doesnt have good judgment eitherCupid has wings and no eyes so hes bound to be reckless and hasty
Thats why they say love is a child
Hell run after her
Is everyone here
First Peter Quince tell us what the play is about then read the names of the actors and then shut up
Answer when I call your nameNick Bottom the weaver
Here
Tell me which part Im going to play then go on
You Nick Bottom have been cast as Pyramus
Whats Pyramus
Ill moan very believablyName the other actorsBut Im really in the mood to play a tyrant
I could do a great job with Hercules or any other part that requires ranting and raving
A lover would have to be weepier of course
Francis Flute the bellowsrepairman
Here Peter Quince
Whos Thisbe
A knight on a quest
Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with
No come on dont make me play a woman
Im growing a beard
That doesnt matter
Youll wear a mask and you can make your voice as high as you want to
In that case if I can wear a mask let me play Thisbe too
Bottom youre PyramusAnd Flute youre Thisbe
Robin Starveling the tailor
Here Peter Quince
Robin Starveling youre going to play Thisbes motherTom Snout the handyman
Here Peter Quince
I hope this play is well cast now
Do you have the lions part written down
If you do please give it to me because I need to start learning the lines
Let me play the lion too
And that would get us all executed
Yeah that would get every single one of us executed
Well my friends youve got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies theyd have no choice but to execute us
Because Pyramus is a goodlooking man the most handsome man that you could find on a summers day a lovely gentlemanly man
So youre the only one who could play Pyramus
Well then Ill do it
What kind of beard should I wear for the part
Whatever kind you want I guess
No youll see four days will quickly turn into four nights
And since we dream at night time passes quickly then
Finally the new moon curved like a silver bow in the sky will look down on our wedding celebration
Sadness is only appropriate for funerals
We dont want it at our festivities
But Ill marry you under different circumstanceswith extravagant festivals public festivities and celebration
Long live Theseus our famous and respected duke
Ill play the part wearing either a strawcolored beard or a sandy beard or a red beard or one of those bright yellow beards thats the color of a French coin
Its best to rehearse there because if we do it here in the city well be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play
Meanwhile Ill make a list of props that well need for the play
Dont leave me in the lurch
Well be there and there well rehearse courageously and wonderfully truly obscenely
Goodbye
Well meet at the giant oak tree in the dukes forest
Got it
Be there or dont show your face again
Hello spirit
Where are you going
I go over hills and valleys through bushes and thorns over parks and fencedin spaces through water and fire
I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth
I work for Titania the Fairy Queen and organize fairy dances for her in the grass
The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards
Their sweet smells come from those little freckles
Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower
Goodbye you dumb old spirit
Ive got to go
The queen and her elves will be here soon
Hes furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king
He wants the child for himself to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests
Instead she puts flowers in the boys hair and makes a fuss over him 
You do their work for them and give them good luck
Thats you right
What you say is true
Thats me youre talking about the playful wanderer of the night
When she takes a sip I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck
But I slip from underneath her and she falls down crying Ow my butt and starts coughing and then everyone laughs and has fun
But step aside fairy
Here comes Oberon
And heres my mistress Titania
I wish hed go away
How  What are you jealous OberonFairies lets get out of here
Ive sworn Ill never sleep with him or talk to him again
Wait just a minute you brazen hussy
The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta
She was your bootwearing mistress and your warrior lover and now that shes getting married to Theseus youve come to celebrate their marriage
How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta when you know that I know about your love for Theseus
Werent you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night right after hed raped her
And werent you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends like Aegles Ariadne and Antiopa
These are nothing but jealous lies
We havent been able to meet on a hill or in a valley in the forest or a meadow by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us
And because you interrupt us so that we cant dance for them the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood just to get revenge on you
So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe
Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep
So the pale angry moon who controls the tides fills the air with diseases
Spring summer fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places and now the confused world doesnt know which is which
And this is all because of our argument
We are responsible for this 
Do something about it then
You have the power to fix it
Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon
All Im asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew
Get over it
I wont give up this child for all of Fairyland
How long do you plan to stay here in this forest
Maybe until after Theseuss wedding day
If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations then you can come with us
If not leave me alone and Ill stay away from your turf
Give me that boy and Ill come with you
Not for your entire fairy kingdomCome fairies lets go
Were going to have an outandout brawl if I stay any longer
Well go on your way then
You wont leave this grove until Ive paid you back for this insult
Yes I remember
You couldnt see him but I could
He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts
But I could see that Cupids fiery arrow was put out by watery virginal moonbeams so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love
But I paid attention to where Cupids arrow fell
It fell on a little western flower which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love
Young girls call it loveinidleness Bring me that flower
I showed it to you once
If its juice is put on someones eyelids while theyre asleep that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees
Bring me this plant and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles
I could go around the world in forty minutes
When I have the juice of that flower Ill trickle some drops of it on Titanias eyes while shes sleeping
Shell fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes upeven if its a lion a bear a wolf a bull a monkey or an ape
And before I make her normal againI can cure her by treating her with another plantIll make her give me that little boy as my page
But whos that coming this way
Look I dont love you so stop following me around
Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia
Lysander I want to stop but Hermia stops my heart from beating
You told me they escaped into this forest
And here I am going crazy in the middle of the woods because I cant find my Hermia
Go away get out of here and stop following me
You attract me to you you cruel magnet
But you must not attract iron because my heart is as true as steel
If you let go of your power to attract me I wont have any power to follow you
Do I ask you to follow me
Do I speak to you kindly
Dont I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and cannot love you
Yes but that makes me love you even more
Im your little dog Demetrius
The more you beat me the more Ill love you
Treat me like you would treat a dogkick me hit me neglect me try to lose me
Just let me follow behind you even though Im not good enough for you
Just looking at you makes me sick
And I get sick when I cant look at you
I rely on your virtue to protect me
This forest doesnt seem deserted when youre here because you are all the world to me
So how can anyone say Im alone when the whole world is here to look at me
Ill run away from you and hide in the bushes and leave you to the mercy of wild animals
The wildest animal isnt as cruel as you are
Leave me alone
Or if you follow me youd better understand that Ill do something bad to you in the forest
Yes you already hurt me in the church in the town and in the fields
Shame on you Demetrius
Your behavior is an insult to all women
We cannot fight for love as men can
Ill follow you and turn this hell Im in into a kind of heaven
Goodbye nymph
Before he leaves this part of the forest youll change places youll be the one running away and hell be in love with you
Do you have the flower
Welcome traveler
Yes here it is
Please give it to me 
Thanks good Egeus
Whats new with you
Im here full of anger to complain about my daughter HermiaStep forward DemetriusMy lord this man Demetrius has my permission to marry herStep forward LysanderBut this other man Lysander has cast a magic spell over my childs heartYou you Lysander youve given her poems and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter
Youve pretended to be in love with her singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight and youve captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair rings toys trinkets knickknacks little presents flowers and candiesthings that can really influence an impressionable young person
Youve connived to steal my daughters heart making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient like she should beAnd my gracious duke if she wont agree to marry Demetrius right now I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens
Since she belongs to me I can do what I want with heras the law says I can either make her marry Demetriusor have her killed
What do you have to say for yourself Hermia
Demetrius is an admirable man
Titania sleeps there sometimes at night lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights
Snakes shed their skin there and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in
Ill put the juice of this flower on Titanias eyes and fill her with horrible delusions and desires
Dont worry sir
Im at your service
Okay lets go
Everythings fine now
One of us will stay and stand guard
Whatever you see first when you wake up think of it as your true love
Wake up when something nasty is nearby
Lets do that Lysander
Im going to rest my head on this little slope
Well have one heart one bed two bodies and one faithful vow
No Lysander
Dont sleep so close to me
I just meant that our hearts are joined so we can almost think of them as one heart
So let me sleep next to you
Stay away for now and good night my sweet friend
I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life
Amen to that
Ill sleep over here
Stop Demetrius
Stop even if only to kill me
Im telling you get out of here and dont follow me around like this
Oh will you leave me alone in the dark
Dont
Stay here at your own risk
Im going on alone
Oh Im out of breath from this foolish chase
The more I pray the less I get out of it
Hermia is lucky wherever she is because she has beautiful eyes
How did her eyes get so bright
Not from crying
If thats the case tears wash my eyes more than hers
No no Im as ugly as a bear since animals that see me run away in terror
So its no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermias starry eyes
Dont say that Lysander
Dont say that
Why do you care that he loves Hermia
What does it matter
Happy with Hermia
No
I regret all the boring time I wasted with her
I dont love Hermia I love Helena
Fruits and vegetables dont ripen until the right season of the year
Likewise Im young and my sense of reason has just ripened
Is it not enough is it not enough young man that Ill never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius
Do you have to harp on my inadequacy
But goodbye
I have to tell you I thought you were a much kinder person than this
Oh how awful that a lady whos been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one
Are we all here
Right on time
This is the perfect place to rehearse
This clearing will be the stage and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room
Peter Quince What is it jolly Bottom
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work
First of all Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself which the ladies in the audience wont be able to stand
What should we do about that
I think well have to leave out all the killing come to think of it
Not at all
Ive got a plan that will fix everything
Ill tell them that we wont hurt anyone with our swords and that Pyramus isnt really dead
And to make it even clearer we can tell them that Im playing Pyramus but Im not really Pyramusreally Im Bottom the weaver
Thatll keep them from being afraid
All right well have a prologue then
Well write it in alternating eight and sixsyllable lines just like in a ballad
No add a couple more syllables
Make it eight and eight
Wont the ladies be scared of the lion
Im really worried about that
Theres no scarier wild bird than the living lion and we should remember that
So we need another prologue to tell everyone hes not a real lion
No we can just announce the actors name and let his face show through the lion costume and have him say something himself
Because you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight
So is Lysander
Youre right Lysanders admirable too
But since your father doesnt want him to marry you you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man
I wish my father could see them with my eyes
No you must see them as your father sees them
Your grace please forgive me
But please tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius
So think carefully about what you want beautiful Hermia
Consider how young you are and question your feelings
Will the moon be shining on the night were performing our play
We need a calendar
Look in the almanac
Look up moonshine look up moonshine
What do you think Bottom
He can hold his fingers in a Vshape like this and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack
If we can do that everything will be all right
Now sit down everybody and rehearse your partsPyramus you start
When you have said your lines go hide in that bushEveryone else go there too when youre not onstage
Speak PyramusThisbe come forward
Yes you are
Youre supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back  
Thats Ninuss grave man
And dont say all of that yet
You just said all your lines at once cues and allPyramus enter
Its never get tired Oh
Help
Its a monster
Were being haunted
Run everyone run
Ill follow you
Sometimes Ill turn into fire
And Ill neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn
Why are they running away
Oh Bottom youve changed
What have you got on your head
What do you think Ive got on my head
Youre acting like an ass dont you think
God bless you Bottom God bless you
Reborn
But I wont leave this spot no matter what they do
Ill walk up and down and sing a song so theyll know Im not afraid
Whod waste his time talking to such a stupid bird
I dont think youve got much of a reason to love me
But to tell you the truth reason and love have very little to do with each other these days
Its too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesnt introduce them
Youre as wise as you are beautiful
No thats not true
But if I were smart enough to get out of this forest Id be wise enough to satisfy myself
Im no ordinary fairy
So come with me
And Ill turn you into a spirit like us so you wont die as humans doCome here Peaseblossom Cobweb Moth and Mustardseed
Ready
Me too
Me too
And me too
Where should we go
Be kind and polite to this gentleman
Leap and dance for him
Feed him apricots and blackberries with purple grapes green figs and mulberries
Pluck off colorful butterfly wings and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps
Bow to him fairies and curtsy to him
Hello mortal
Hello
Hello
Hello
I beg your pardon sirsPlease tell me your name sir
Cobweb
Id like to get to know you better Mr Cobweb
If I cut my finger Ill use you as a bandage to stop the bleedingAnd your name sir
Peaseblossom
Please give my regards to your mother Mrs Peapod and your father Mr Peapod
Good Mr Peaseblossom Id like to get to know you better tooAnd you may I ask what your name is sir
Mustardseed
Good Mr Mustardseed I know you very well
Those cowardly gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef
I swear to you many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before
I look forward to getting to know you better Mr Mustardseed
Take good care of him
Take him to my sleeping area
The moon looks sad to me
When she cries all the little flowers cry too
Keep my lover quiet
Bring him to me in silence
Ah here comes my messengerWhats going on you crazy spirit
What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest
My mistress Titania is in love with a monster
I led them on in this frightened distracted state and left sweet
At that exact moment Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him an ass
This is going even better than I planned
But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian as I asked you to do
Yes I found him when he was asleepso thats taken care of tooand the Athenian woman was sleeping near him
Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much
Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy
If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping then youre already up to your ankles in blood
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime
Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep
The only possibility is that youve murdered him
A murderer should look like you do so pale and grim
Thats how someone whos been murdered should look and thats how I look
Youve pierced me through the heart with your cruelty and yet you the murderer look as bright and clear as a star in the sky
What does that have to do with my Lysander
Where is he
Oh good Demetrius will you find him for me
Did you kill him then
Oh how brave of you
A snake could do that as easily as you could
A snake did do it because no snake ever had a more forked lying tongue than you have
I didnt kill Lysander
As far as I know hes not even dead
Then please tell me hes all right
If I told you that what would I get out of it
Please give in sweet HermiaAnd Lysander stop acting like shes yours
Her father loves you Demetrius
Shes mine and Im giving her to Demetrius  
The privilege of never seeing me again
And now Im going to leave your despised company
Youll never see me again whether or not hes dead
So Ill stay here for a while
Thats the way of the world
Go around the forest moving faster than the wind and make sure you find Helena of AthensShes lovesick and her face is pale from all the sighing shes been doing because sighing is bad for the blood
You purple flower hit by Cupids arrow sink into the pupils of this mans eyes
Young man when you wake up if shes nearby beg her to cure your lovesickness
Should we watch this ridiculous scene
Lord what fools these mortals are
Step aside
The noise theyre making will wake up Demetrius
Then the two of them will both pursue one girl
Why do you think Im making fun of you when I tell you I love you
People dont cry when theyre mocking someone 
How can it seem like Im making fun of you when my tears prove that Im sincere
You get trickier and trickier
Will you abandon her
Demetrius loves her and he doesnt love you
Damn it
I see youre all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs
Youre competing for
Dont be cruel Demetrius
In exchange give up your claim to love Helena since I love her and will love her until I die
Lysander keep your Hermia
I dont want her
Helena its not true
Look here comes the woman you love
Its hard to see clearly in the dark of night but its easier to hear well 
I couldnt see you Lysander but I heard your voice and thats how I found you
Why did you leave me alone so unkindly
Why stay when love tells you to go
But what love could make my Lysander leave me
I had to hurry to my love beautiful Helena who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars
Why are you looking for me
Didnt you figure out that I left you because I hate you
You cant mean what youre saying
Its impossible
So shes in on this too
Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me
Have you forgotten all the talks weve had together the vows we made to be like sisters to one another all the hours we spent together wishing that we never had to say goodbyehave you forgotten
Our friendship in our schooldays our childhood innocence
We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles sewing it on one piece of cloth sitting on the same cushion singing one song in the same key as if our hands our sides our voices and our minds were stuck together
We grew together like twin cherrieswhich seemed to be separate but were also togethertwo lovely cherries on one stem 
There is scorn and disdain in her eyes and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon
She cant even imagine what love is
It would be bad if she knew about Benedicks love and teased him about it
Its true
And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has
But who would dare tell her
If I said something shed mock me so mercilessly that Id probably disintegrate into air
Shed laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit
Like a fire that gets covered up Benedick should smother his love and waste away
It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked which is as bad as being killed by tickling
No instead Ill go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions
You dont know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word
Oh dont injure your cousin like that
With the quick intelligent wit shes rumored to have she cant really be such a bad judge of character that shed refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick
Hes the only worthy man in Italy aside from my dear Claudio
True he has an excellent reputation
And he deserves it having been excellent before he had a reputation for it
When are you getting married madam
Tomorrow and then every day after that
Come on lets go inside
Ill stay in Messina until youre married and then Ill go to Aragon
Ill go with you my lord if youll allow me
No taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it
Ill ask only Benedick to come with me for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet hes a joker
Hes evaded love once or twice and since then Cupid doesnt dare to shoot at him
Benedicks heart is like a bell with his tongue as the clapper everything his heart thinks his tongue speaks
Gentleman I am not the same man I was before
I agree
I hope hes in love
There isnt a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love
If he looks serious he must need money
What are you moaning on about your toothache
I repeat hes in love
Unless youre talking about his love for this kind of foolishnesswhich judging from his appearance he hashe is no fool for love as you pretend
If hes not in love with a woman then you cant trust the usual symptoms
He brushes his hat in the mornings
What do you think that means
Has any man seen him at the barbers
No but the barbers assistant has been seen with him
And hes rubbed himself with perfume
Can you smell out his secret now
But when  You take up your duties too cheerfully
Thats what her mother always tells me
Ah he got you back Benedick
Congratulations lady you resemble a most honorable man
Well even if he is her father Im sure she wouldnt want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders
Im amazed youre still talking Signior Benedick
No ones listening to you
Look its my dear Lady Disdain
Arent you dead yet
Thats as good as proof that the sweet young mans in love
The biggest clue is his seriousness
And when has he ever been known to wash his face
Yes or to wear cosmetics
I hear what they say about him for doing that
Indeed his mocking spirit has now crawled into a  Truly it all adds up to a serious story for Benedick
A conclusion a conclusion he is in love
Oh and I know who loves him
Shell be buried with her face upwards then
This chatter is no cure for my toothache
It must be
My lord and brother God save you
Good evening brother
If you dont mind Id like to speak with you
In private
If you wish
But Count Claudio can stay for what Im about to say concerns him
Whats the matter
You know that he does
I dont know that once he knows what I know
If theres any reason we shouldnt get married I urge you to tell me
You may think that I dont love you
I hope that after I tell you my news you will think better of me
My brother thinks highly of you and because of his affection has helped arrange your marriagebut that was definitely a waste of his time and energy
Why whats the matter
I came here to tell youIll make this short since shes already been talked about for too longthe lady is unfaithful
Who Hero
Thats the one Leonatos Hero your Hero every mans Hero
Unfaithful
The word is too good to represent her wickedness
She is worse than wicked
If you can think of a more awful title Ill call her that
But dont keep wondering without more proof
Come with me tonight and youll see a man enter her bedroom chambereven tonight the night before her wedding
If you still love her after that then marry her tomorrow
But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind
I wont consider it
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her Ill shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her
And since I wooed her in your name Ill join you in disgracing her
Remain calm until midnight and then youll see what the trouble is
Oh this day has turned into a disaster
Oh mischief has ruined our plans
Oh a plague has been prevented thank God
Thats what youll say once youve seen part two
Are you all good and honest men
Come here Sir Seacole
God has blessed you with a good name
To be goodlooking is a matter of luck but to read and write is a natural gift
Both of which master constable You have
I knew that would be your answer
Well for your good looks sir thank God and dont boast about it
Youre thought to be the most 
you will  And what if he wont stop
Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that youve gotten rid of such a criminal
If he wont stop when hes told to then he isnt one of the Princes subjects
We know whats appropriate for a watch
Why you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman
Also youre supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone whos drunk to go home and go to bed
And what if they wont go
Well then leave them alone until theyre sober
If even then they dont answer to your satisfaction you can say that theyre not the men you thought they were
Very good sir
So if we know that a man is a thief should we try to arrest him
You constable are representing the Prince himself
If you meet the Prince in the night you can order him to stop
No by our Lady I dont think he can
Ill bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it
By our Lady I think thats true
And if anything important happens find me and let me know
Well gentlemen weve heard our assignment
Lets sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed
One more thing good gentlemen
Watch over Signior Leonatos house with the wedding being held there tomorrow theres a great todo there tonight
Adieu
Be  Conrade
Conrade I say
Come to think of it I thought I felt a scab there
Ill get you for that
Now get on with your story
Since its drizzling stand under this overhang with me and like a true drunk Ill tell you everything
You should know Ive earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John
Is it possible that any crime could be so valuable
You should ask instead if its possible that any criminal could be so rich
Because when rich villains need poor villains services those poor ones can name the price
I cant believe it
That only proves how inexperienced you are
You know that the style of a mans jacket or hat or coat means nothing
Yes its just clothing
Yes fashion is fashion
Cmon I might as well say the fools the fool
But dont you see what a    Did you hear someone
Just the weathervane moving
But youre all wound up about fashion too
No Im not wound up
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret the Lady Heros waiting woman tonight
I should backtrack and begin with how my master Don John arranged for the Prince Claudio and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard
That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor
All ladies love me except you
Its too bad Im so hardhearted because I really dont love anyone
Women are lucky then
You would make a nasty suitor
I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me
Well I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up
If he has a face like yours a good scratching couldnt make him look any worse
Listen to you instructing me like a parrot would
Id rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you
I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless
Thats itIm done
You always slip out of the argument like this
I know you from before
And thats everything LeonatoClaudio Benedickmy dear friend Leonato has invited you all to stay here at Messina
I told him well stay for at least a month and he says that he hopes well stay longer
I think hes actually serious and not just being polite
And they thought Margaret was Hero
We charge you in the Princes name to stop
Call up the Master Constable Dogberry
We have  And one of them is the criminal Deformed
I know him he wears a lock of hair
Gentlemen gentlemen   Gentlemen dont speak
We 
Were probably a very valuable catch for these guys
Lets go well obey you
Good Ursula go wake my cousin and ask her to get up
I will lady
And request that she come here
Very well
Really I think your other ruff is better
No please good Meg Ill wear this one
Honestly its not as good as the other one and Im sure your cousin will agree with me
My cousins a fool and you are too
Ill wear this one and none other
I like your new wig and headdress though Id like it more if the hair were a shade browner
You know I saw the Duchess of Milans gown the one that everyone praises so highly
Oh they say that dress surpasses all others
But for a fine elegant graceful and excellent dress yours is worth ten of those
I hope I enjoy wearing it for my heart is very heavy
It will be made even heavier soonby the weight of a man
Shame of what lady
Sex and marriage are honorable thingseven for a beggar right
And isnt your husband an honorable man
Good morning sweet Hero
Why do you sound so odd
Are you ill
You sound out of tune
You sing and Ill dance
Never
The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves
Sorry Im all stuffed
Ever since you lost yours
Doesnt my wit suit me well
It doesnt get seen enough you should wear it in your cap the way fools wear coxcombs
God Im really sick
I just meant that you should use some holy thistle
Maybe you think that I think youre in love
No by Our Lady Im not such a fool to think what I please and I dont please to think what I can and in fact I cannot think even if I could think my heart right past thinking that you are in love or that you will be in love or even that you can be in love
But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well and now hes become a real man
He swore that hed never get married but now despite his earlier protestations he loves ungrudgingly
And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does
Its not a false gallop anyway
Madam we have to go the Prince the Count Signior Benedick Don John and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church
Good cousin good Meg good Ursula come help me get dressed
What do you want from me my good man
Indeed sir it is
Yes it truly is
Whats the news my good friends
Sorry sir Goodman Verges tends to ramble
Thank you for saying that your Worship but were just the poor dukes officers
But truly if I were as 
Oh so youd give me all your tediousness
Yes even if I had a thousand more pounds than that for I hear that you are  Me too
God gives those giftsI had nothing to do with it
Now I must return to the wedding
One more thing sir
Examine them yourselves then bring me your findings
Now Im in a great hurry as Im sure you can see
Goodbye
My lord theyre waiting for you to give your daughter away to Claudio
Im coming
Go to Francis Seacole the constable of the watch
Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail
We wont hold back any of our wisdom
Well drive them to a 
I am being serious my lord
Thank you
Im not a man who talks a lot but I thank you
If it pleases you your highness will you lead us all inside
Give me your hand Leonato
We will go in together
Benedick did you notice Signior Leonatos daughter
I saw her but I didnt notice her
Isnt she a wellmannered young lady
Do you want my true opinion
Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women
No please speak seriously
Well it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly too dark to be praised fairly and too small to be praised greatly
I can only say this about her if she looked different than she does she would be ugly and since she cant be anything but herself I dont like her
You think Im kidding
Please tell me seriously what you think of her
All right Friar Francis lets keep this short
No
No he comes to be married  Lady do you come here to be married to this count
I do
If either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage I order you on your souls to say so
Do you know any Hero
None my lord
Do you know any count
Im sure I can answer for himhe doesnt know any either
Oh the things men dare to do
The things men are allowed to do
The things men do daily not knowing what theyre doing
What are we playing with interjections
Well then add some interjections that indicate laughter like  Hold on Friar
As freely son as God gave her to me
And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift
Nothing sir except grandchildren
There Leonato take your daughter back
She only appears honorable from the outside
Look how she blushes like a virgin
Oh sin can disguise itself so artfully
Doesnt that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent
All of you who are looking at her wouldnt you swear that shes a virgin judging by these outward shows
But she is no virgin
She has been in a mans bed
She blushes from guilt not modesty
What do you mean my lord
My dear lord if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity I know what youre about to say
And have I ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you
Curse you for your false appearances
Is that why youre talking so wildly
Good Prince say something
What should I say
Ive been dishonored I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore
Are you really saying these things or am I dreaming
Theyre really being spoken sir and theyre true
This doesnt look like a wedding
Its true
Oh God
Leonato am I standing here
Is this the Prince
Is this the Princes brother
Is this face Heros
Are these our eyes
Yes thats all truebut what do you mean by it my lord
Let me just ask her one question and by your authority as her father order her to answer truthfully
As my child I order you to do so
Oh God help me
What kind of game is this
We just want you to answer to your real name
Isnt my name Hero
Who can stain that name with a just accusation
Indeed Hero herself can
Youve stained your virtue with your own actions
What man were you talking to at your window last night between the hours of midnight and one
If youre a virgin youll answer this question
I wasnt talking to any man at that time my lord
I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night
Pretty lady Im much ashamed of your shocking behavior
Whats wrong cousin
Why have you collapsed
Come lets go
These revelations have overwhelmed her
How is she
Shes dead I thinkHelp uncleHero why Hero
Uncle
Signior Benedick
Friar
Death is the best way to cover over her shame
How are you Hero
Yes why shouldnt she
Why not
Isnt every living thing condemning her
Am I sorry that I only had one child
Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty
Oh one child is one too many
Why did I ever have one
Why did you once seem lovely to me
Why didnt I just adopt a beggars child left at my doorstep whose shame and dishonor I could have denied not being its true father
Sir sir calm down
Im so amazed by this I dont know what to say
Oh on my soul my cousin has been slandered falsely
Lady did you sleep in her room last night
No I didnt but I did every night for the past year
Then its confirmed
And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity
But she must be Friar
You see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges she doesnt want to add perjury to her list of sins
The princes are under some strange misunderstanding
Two of them are completely honorable and if they have been tricked in this we must blame John the Bastard who lives to create conflict
I dont know
If they have spoken the truth about Hero I will tear her apart with my bare hands
Age hasnt dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much and luck hasnt robbed me of so much of my fortune and my bad ways havent deprived me of so many friends that they wont find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally with money and friends at my disposal
Hold on a moment and listen to my advice
The princes left your daughter here for dead
Hide her for a while in your house and tell everyone that she has in fact died
Make a bug show of mourning for her hang sad epitaphs up at your familys tomb and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies
Why should we do this
What will this do
That will be a good thing
Well maintain that she died the instant she was accused and everyone who hears this will grieve for her pity her and excuse her actions
Thats how Claudio will respond
And even if they dont at least Heros supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity
And if it doesnt go well then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputationaway from the publics eyes tongues mind and insults
Signior Leonato listen to the friars plan
And even though you know Im very close to the Prince and Claudio I swear Ill keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly
Are you thinking of buying her
But tell me are you speaking seriously
Or are you just teasing
If Im going to sing along with you I need to know what key youre singing in
I think shes the most wonderful woman Ive ever laid eyes on
Im still young enough to see without glasses and I dont see what youre talking about
But hey this doesnt mean youre looking to get married does it
Even if I had sworn never to marry I wouldnt trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me
Whats going on these days
Isnt there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife
Look Don Pedro has come back for you
This is a good agreement
Come lady you must die in order to live
Hopefully your wedding day is only postponed
Have patience and endure
Lady Beatrice have you been crying this entire time
Yes and Ill keep crying a while longer
I dont wish that on you
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused
Oh the man who avenged her could ask anything of me
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you
A very clear way but there is no friend who will undertake it
Can a man do it
Its a job meant for a man but not you
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you
Isnt that strange
Its as strange as this other thing which I dont understand
I feel awful for my cousin
By my sword Beatrice you love me
Not with any sauce they could provide for them
I swear I love you
Well then God forgive me
Why what have you done sweet Beatrice
You got to me first
I was about to swear that I loved you
Then do so with all your heart
I love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with
Come ask me to do anything for you
Kill Claudio
Ha
I wouldnt do that for the whole wide world
Then rejecting my request you kill 
Wait sweet Beatrice
My body waits here but the rest of me is gone
You dont really love me
I beg you to let me go
Beatrice I swear Im going
Not until we part as friends
How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy
Is Claudio your enemy
Hasnt he proven himself to be a great villainslandering scorning and dishonoring my cousin
Oh I wish I were a man
He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows and thenwith public accusation blatant slander pure hatredOh God if only I were a man
I would rip his heart out in public and eat it
Listen to me Beatrice Talking with a man outside her bedroom window
A likely story
No but Beatrice Sweet Hero shes been wronged shes been slandered shes been ruined
Beat
Princes and counts
Hes a proper count that Count Sugarplum a sweet gentleman for sure
Oh if only I were a man
Or had a friend who would be a man for me
All this conversing has turned men into tonguesand fancy ones at that
The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules
I cant make myself a man by wishing I were so as a woman Ill die from grieving
Wait good Beatrice
I swear by this hand that I love you
Dont just swear by it put your hand to some use that will prove you love me
Thats enough for me then
Ill challenge him
Ill kiss your hand and with that I leave you
I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this
Keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin
Which ones are the malefactors
Sir that would be me and my partner
Have them come in front of the master constable
Yes indeed bring them before me
Whats your name friend
Borachio
Please write down BorachioAnd yours
Im a gentleman sir and my name is Conrade
Write down Master Gentleman ConradeGentlemen are you good Christians and do you serve God
Yes sir we hope so
How do you both plead
Honestly sir we say that we are not criminals
Hes a marvelously witty fellow no doubt but Ill outmaneuver himCome over here Ill whisper a word in your ear
Sir I tell you we believe youre both lying criminals
Sir I tell you that we are not
Well okayI swear to God both their stories match
Have you written that down that they arent criminals
Master Constable youre going about this all wrong
First you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them
Yes good idea thats the 
This man said sir that Don John the Princes brother was a villain
Write down that Prince John is a villain
I swear I dont like the look of you
That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero
Thats burglary that is
Yes by God that it is
What else did you hear
What else
Thats all
Ill get there first and tell him what we found out
Honest to God wheres the sexton
Come on tie them up
Get away from me you ass
You ass
Dont you suspect my office
Dont you 
If you keep on the way youve been going youll kill yourself
Stop advising me your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve
Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask
So dont advise me
Please leave me alone
I intend to be flesh and blood not airy philosophy for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune
But dont take all that pain on yourself
Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too
Now youre talking
I definitely will
In my soul I believe Hero has been falsely accused
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way
Good evening good evening
Good day to both of you
Listen my lords Were in a bit of a hurry Leonato
Your highness will have to force me to tell
Its good if you love Hero because shes worthy of your love
Youre trying to trick me my lord
I swear Im telling you what I honestly think
A bit of a hurry my lord
Well then good bye my lord
Youre in a hurry are you
Well then dont bother
Come on dont quarrel with us good old man
If its fighting he is after some of us here should run and hide
Who has wronged him
Indeed you have wronged me you liar
Dont bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword
Im not scared of you
Curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you
Really I had no intention of going for my sword
Damn you dont mock and sneer at me
Im not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young and what he would do now if he werent so old
Claudio Im telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child
You have ruined my innocent child
Your slander has broken her heart and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tombancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness
My wickedness
Yours Claudio yours I say
Youve got it wrong old man
Ill beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does despite his youth and manliness
Not a chance
Ill have nothing to do with you
You think you can get rid of me that easily
You killed my child
Take on someone your own size if you kill me boy youll have killed a man
Hell have to kill both of us and indeed were both men
But let him start off easy by killing one of us
Come onkill me and brag about it
Let me at him
I will as surely as I am a gentleman
Brother Quiet
God knows I loved my niece and now shes deadslandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue
Brother Anthony
Hold your peace
But brother Anthony Dont its no big deal
Dont bother with it
Let me deal with this
Gentlemen we wont stay here and anger you further
Im sorry about your daughters death but I swear our accusations were true and backed up with proof
My lord my lord I dont want to hear any more about it
No
Come on brother
Im determined to be heard by someone
And you will be or some people here will suffer for it
Look here comes just the man we were looking for
Whats up mister
Welcome sir
You just missed a fight that was barely avoided
We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth
Leonato and his brother
What do you think
I think if we had fought we would have proven too young and strong for them after all
Theres no bravery in an unfair fight
Look Benedick is so paleare you sick or angry
Lighten up
Sir dont even try to beat me in a battle of wits
Ill meet all your attacks even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop
Choose another tack
I think he really is angry
If he is thats his problem
Can I have a word with you privately
God forbid he wants to challenge me
lain
Youve killed an innocent woman and youre going to pay dearly for her death
What do you say
What are we having a feast
Yes we are
Benedick Beatrice praised your wit the other day
I said you had a fine wit
True she said a fine little one No I said a huge wit Right she said a hugely awful one No I said he has a good wit Exactly she said its good and mild it doesnt hurt anyone No I said Benedick is wise He is certainly she said  She cried a lot at that and said she didnt care
That she did
And yet for all that if she didnt hate him to death shed love him to death
Leonatos daughter had told us everything
Absolutely everything
And moreover God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden
But when exactly will we see Benedick married
Yes with the sign underneath him that says Here lives Benedick the married man
Goodbye boy
You know what I intend
Ill leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman
The wit you flaunt is like a blunt swordit cant hurt anyone thank GodMy lord I thank you for your many kindnesses
Im leaving your court now
Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina
The three of you have killed a sweet innocent woman
Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel and good luck to him then
Hes serious
Very serious and Im sure its because of Beatrice
And he challenged you to a duel
He did very sincerely
What a strange sighta man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home
A guy like that is bigger than an ape but the ape could be his doctor its so much smarter
But wait a minute
Let me gather my wits and get serious here
Didnt he say my brother has run away
Come on you
If they let you off then well have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power
Since you are a lying hypocrite we must look after you
Whats this
Two of my brothers men all tied up
Officers what crime have these men committed
Well sir theyve lied moreover they have said things that were not true secondarily they are slanderers sixth and lastly they have falsely accused a lady thirdly they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen and in conclusion they are lying scoundrels
First I ask you what theyve done thirdly I ask you what offense theyre charged with sixth and lastly I ask you why theyve been committed here and in conclusion I ask what theyre accused of
I tricked your own eyes
Theyve recorded my crimes and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story
The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master
His words are like poison to me
Yes and paid me well for doing it
He is made of treachery and has run away to avoid his crimes
Sweet Hero when I imagine you now you seem as beautiful as you did when I first loved you
Come take away the  Here comes Master Signior Leonato with the sexton
Which one of them did it
Let me see what he looks like so when I see another man who resembles him Ill know to avoid him
Which one is it
If you want to see your deceiver then look at me
Are you the slave who with your slanderous words killed my innocent child
Yes I am the one
No villain but you didnt work alone
I dont know how to ask you for forgiveness but I have to say something
Choose your revenge
I cant ask you to make my daughter livethats impossiblebut I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died
And if your love can produce something from its sadness write a poem for her hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones
Sing it tonight
Then come to my house tomorrow morning and since you couldnt be my soninlaw be my nephew instead
My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero this girl is heir to both our estates
Marry her as you should have married her cousin and I will let my revenge die
And  I feel that I love her
I know that she is worthy of that love
Or in the power of reason
I was conceived by a woman and I thank her very much for all her effort
And then she brought me up and I thank her for that too
I swear before I die Im going to see you sick with love
With anger with fever or with hunger sure my friend but never sick with love
If you can prove that Ill ever be so in love that I cant be brought to my senses with a good round of beers you can pluck out my eyes with a lovepoets pen and hang me on a brothels door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes
Oh noble sir
Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep
I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands
I will see you tomorrow then
Now I have to leave
This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot
Thank you for all your efforts
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy and may God bless you  
God save the charitable organization
I leave a slimy bastard with you your Worship for you to punish and make an example of
God bless your Worship
I wish you well
I hope that God restores you to health
Goodbye gentlemen
Well see you tomorrow
Well be there
I will mourn Hero tonight  
Please Margaret help me write this poem for Beatrice
You certainly deserve it
Its just that my wit is very gentlemanly Margaret and refuses to hurt a woman
Now please tell Beatrice to come out
Ill go get Beatrice for you who can walk here by herselfshe has legs
So that means shell come
Im really a pitiful singer
Take  Beatrice have you come because I called for you
Yes sir and Ill leave when you ask me to
Oh well stay till then
I spoke angry foul words to him and with that I will kiss you
If you had foul words in your mouth then your breath must be foul and foul breath is nauseating
Thus Ill leave without being kissed
Your wit is so forceful it frightens the very meaning out of your words
But I will tell you this very plainly I have challenged Claudio and either hell accept the challenge or admit hes a coward
Now tell mewhich of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first
With all of them at once they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix
But tell mewhich of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me
Suffer love
Thats a good way of putting it
I do suffer love because I love you against my will
You love me in spite of your heart I think
In this day and age if a man doesnt erect his own monument before he dies he wont be remembered past the funeral bells ringing and his widows crying
Exactly how long is that do you think
About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying
Thats why its better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues like I do
Thats why I praise myself whoif I do say so myselfis quite praiseworthy
But tell me how is your cousin
Im very sick too
Have faith love me and you will get better
Madam you have to go to your uncles
Its been proven that Lady Hero is innocent that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived and that Don Johnwho has run awayis the source of all the trouble
Will you come immediately
Will you come with me to hear this news sir
I will live in your heart die in your lap and be buried in your eyesand whats more I will go with you to your uncles
Is this the family tomb of Leonato
It is my lord
Here lies Hero The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words
To repay her for her troubles Death Gives her undying fame
So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame
This epitaph will hang here forever Continuing to praise Hero after I die
Now start the music and sing the solemn hymn
Now I say good night to your bones Hero
I will perform this ceremony every year
Good morning gentlemen
Put out your torches
The wolves have finished preying for the night and lookthe gentle dawn is rising dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light
Good morning gentlemen
Didnt I tell you she was innocent
And the Prince and Claudio who accused her are innocent as well because they were deceived by Don John
Well Im glad that everything has been sorted out
Me toootherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio
When I send for you come out wearing masks
The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by nowYou know your job brother
You have to pretend to be your nieces father and give her away to Claudio
What do you need me to do
She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her its true
And I see her also through the eyes of love
And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio the Prince and me
But what did you want
Sir Im puzzled by what you just said
And Ill help you
Here comes the Prince and Claudio
Good morning to all these lovely people
Good morning Prince good morning Claudio
Were waiting here for you
Are you still set on marrying my brothers daughter
I wouldnt change my mind even if she were 
Well time will tell
Just you wait
Give him my respects and tell him Ill definitely be there for dinner since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal
Bring her out brother
The friars ready
Good morning Benedick
I think hes nervoushes about to become the savage bull who got domesticated
Oh dont worry about itwell dip your    Ill get you for that one
But here are other matters to be dealt with
Which is the lady Im supposed to marry
This one and I will give her to you
No you cant do that until you take her hand and in front of this friar swear to marry her
Its another Hero
Exactly right
And as surely as I am alive I am a virgin
Its the former Hero
The Hero that died
She was only dead my lord as long as her slander lived
I can confirm that all these shocking things are true
Which one of you is Beatrice
Do you love me
No no more than is reasonable
Well then your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived
They swore you did
Do you love me
Truly nono more than is reasonable
Well then Margaret Ursula and my cousin have been very much deceived for they swore you did
They swore that you were sick with love for me
They swore that you were nearly dead with love for me
Oh well
So you dont love me
No I dontexcept as a friend
Come on niece Im sure you love him
And heres another poem which I stole from my cousins pocketin her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick
What a miracle
Our handwriting gives away our hearts
Come on Ill take you but honestly Im only doing it out of pity
I wont say no to you but let it be known that Im only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life I hear you were quickly wasting away without me
Oh shut up
Ill stop your mouth with a kiss
How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man
Ill tell you what Prince a whole university full of wisecrackers couldnt change my mood today
You think I care what Im called
Well I dont
No before
Musicians play us a songPrince you look sad
You should get a wife
Into Gods hands
From my house if I had a house The sixth of July
Before you make  My lord you could really help me out now
I am at your service
Just tell me what you want me to do and however hard it is youll see that Im eager to do it
Does Leonato have a son my lord
Hero is his only child and his only heir
Do you like her Claudio
Look if you really love the beautiful Hero enjoy it
Isnt that the reason you told me all this
But I didnt want you to think that Im hasty in my emotions
Thats like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses
Ill disguise myself as you and pour out my feelings to Hero taking her prisoner with the force of my love story
Lets get started right away
Has he taken care of the music
He is taking care of it as we speak
But brother I have some strange news for you
Is it good news
Is this servant of yours a smart man
Hes very bright
Ill get him to come here and you can ask him yourself
He must be very near by now
When I left him he was less than nine miles from here
How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought
Not many and no one important
A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely
Claudio deserves to be honored and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly
He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this news
No no until it comes true well pretend it was just a dream we had
But my daughter should know about this so she can be prepared with an answer just in case
Go to her and tell her for me
Cousins you all have work to doOh I beg your pardon
Come with me now and help me out
Really my lord why are you so excessively sad
Therefore my sadness is without limit
You should listen to reason
I cant hide what I am
Sure but dont do it at full volume until theres no danger in it
Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you
You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose
Id rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brothers garden
Though I am not a flattering righteous man at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain
Until that happens let me be who I am and dont try to change me
Cant you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage
I use it all the time since its all that I have
Whos that
Whats going on Borachio
Who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage
Your brothers righthand man
Who
That pretty boy Claudio
Thats the one
Hero the daughter and heir of Leonato
A lively young one
How did you learn about this
As I was working on one musty room the Prince and Claudio entered
Come lets go to the dance
This just may cheer me up
If theres any way I can spoil his life Ill be overjoyed
Youll both help me right
Until the day we die my lord
Lets go to this great feast
Lead the way sir
Wasnt Don John at dinner tonight
I didnt see him
That man always looks so sour
Just looking at him gives me heartburn
He has a very gloomy attitude
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick
One of them is too much like a painting of a manhe never speaksand the other is too much like a spoiled little boy always chattering
So the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John And if he were handsome agile and rich too he could have any woman in the worldall hed need was her good will
Really niece youll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people
Honestly she is too illtempered
Maybe you will find a husband without a beard
And then what would I do with him
So youll go to hell
No just to the gates of hell where the devil will meet me with the horns on his head like a cuckold and say Go up to heaven Beatrice
He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit and Ill have fun there forever
No I wont take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt
What woman wouldnt be distressed being lorded over by a handful of dust
Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay
No uncle I wont be married
If he is too insistent tell him that romance is like a dance it has its own rhythm and timing
The wooing is like a Scottish jig hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion
Niece you are exceptionally perceptive
I have a good eye uncle
I can see whats in broad daylight
The partygoers have arrived
Lets give them room
My lady will you have a dance with me
As long as you move gracefully look handsome and say nothing Im yours for the dance
And when will that be
When I like the way you look for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask
My mask is like the roof of the poor 
If you wish to speak of love speak more softly
Well I wish you liked me
Tell me one
I say my prayers out loud
That makes me love you even more
Amen
Go aheadsay Amen No more talking
Ive got my answer
No really Im not
I can tell by the way you waggle your head
Really Im only pretending to be him
You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself
Look youve got his wrinkled hands
You are Antonio you are he
In short Im not
Come on do you think I cant recognize you by your excellent wit
Can a good thing hide itself
Be quiet you are Antonio
A mans virtues will always show themselves and thats the end of that
Wont you tell me who told you that
No youll have to excuse me
And you wont tell me who you are
Not now
Who said that I was disdainful and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book
Well it must have been Signior Benedick
Whos that
Im sure you know him
No I dont believe me
What he never made you laugh
Yes heavily
Theres no face more sincere than one washed in tears
And its definitely better to cry because youre happy than laugh because youre sad
There was no Signior Montanto in our army
Who are you talking about niece
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua
Oh yes Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever  
Please tell me who is this man
Why hes the Princes fool and a very dull fool at that
Im sure hes out there dancing
I could have sworn he trampled on me
When I meet this gentleman Ill tell him what youve said
Oh please do
And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten because hell be too miserable for dinner
Come on we have to follow the leaders of the dance
In every good thing they do
No if they try to lead us to harm I will leave the dance floor at the next song  
Thats Claudio
You know me too well
I am Benedick
Sir my brother is very fond of you
He is in love with Hero
Please make him change his mind
How do you know he loves her
I heard him swear he did
I did too and he also swore he would marry her tonight
Come on lets get to the banquet
Though I said my name was Benedick I heard this news with Claudios ears
Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself
Friendship is enduring except when love is involved
Therefore all lovers should speak for themselves
Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion
Goodbye then Hero
Claudio
Yes thats me
Will you come with me
Where
Right over to that  I hope he enjoys her
You sound like a cattle dealer thats the way they sell bulls
But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way
Please leave me alone
Look at you thrashing about like a blind man
A boy robbed you but youll beat up the post instead
If you wont leave then 
Oh the poor bird
But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time
The Princes fool
Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful
Yes but I am insulting myself by thinking this way
I dont have that kind of reputation
Well Ill get my revenge
Now sir where is Claudio
Did you see him
Yes my lord I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news
I found him here  Beating
Why what did he do
He was like a schoolboy who finds a birds nest and happily shows it to his friend who then steals it from him
What is trusting a friend such a crime
The criminal is the one who stole the nest
Lady Beatrice is angry with you
The gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her
She speaks daggers and every word stabs
If her breath were as terrible as her words she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star
I wouldnt marry her even if she were as blessed as paradise
Please dont mention her
Look here she comes
Your highness could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth
Ill go to the Antipodes for any little errand you can think of
Really he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice
So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it
Youve humiliated him lady youve put him down
Why are you so sad
Im not sad my lord
What then sick
Im neither my lord
The count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor wellhes just civil as Seville as an orange with the same jealousyellow complexion
Ive told her father and hes given his permission
Tell us when you wish to get married and may God give you joy
Claudio take my daughter and with her take my fortunes
The Prince has made the match and may God bless it
Speak Claudio thats your cue
For you I give myself away and Im ecstatic about the exchange
Truly lady you have a merry heart
Yes my lord
I thank my heartthe poor foolfor it keeps away from seriousness
Look my cousin is whispering to Claudio that she loves him
Why youre absolutely right cousin
Thank the lord for alliances
So everyone goes off into the world except me who stays in because Im sunburned
I should sit in the corner and sing that song HeighHo for a Husband Lady Beatrice Ill get you a husband
Id rather get a husband from your father
Dont you have any brothers like you
Your fathers sons would make excellent husbands if only a girl could catch one for herself
Will you take me my lady
No my lord unless I could have another husband for the work week
You are too expensive to wear every day
But please forgive me your highness
I was born to speak cleverly not seriously
Niece will you take care of those things I mentioned
Oh yes Im sorry uncleIf youll excuse me your grace
I swear shes a very goodnatured lady
Theres very little about her thats gloomy my lord
Shes only sad when she sleepsand not even then
She cant stand to hear about getting a husband
No not at all
She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit
She would make a good wife for Benedick
Oh Lord if they were married theyd drive themselves crazy within a week
Count Claudio when do you plan to go to church and be married
Tomorrow my lord
My lord I will help you even if it means I have to stay awake for ten nights straight
Me too my lord
And you sweet Hero
Ill do any decent thing my lord to help my cousin get a good husband
And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of
This much I can say about him he is wellborn has proven his bravery in battle and has established his good character
Come inside with me and I will tell you my plan
But Im sure hell get even with you
Signior Benedick served well in the war my lady
You had rotten food and he helped you eat it
Hes a good soldier too lady
Hes a lord to a lord and a man to a man
He is positively stuffed with honorable virtues
Absolutelyhe is stuffed like a dummy
Please dont take my niece the wrong way sir
Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves
Whenever they meet theres a little battle
Every month he has a new best friend
Is that possible
Its arranged
The Count Claudio will marry Leonatos daughter
Yes my lord but I can spoil it
Any obstacle or barrier to Claudios happiness will be like medicine to me
I hate him so much it makes me sick and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy
How will you wreck this marriage
I can only do it by lying my lord but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me
Quickly tell me how
I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret Heros servant woman likes me
I remember
I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night she looks out Heros bedroom window
How will that kill this marriage
That part is up to you
What will be my evidence
Evidence enough to deceive the Prince anger Claudio ruin Hero and kill Leonato
Is there anything else you wish
Thats all I want and Ill do anything to accomplish it
Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone
Tell them you know that Hero loves me
Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince who has compromised his honor by making the match and Claudio whose reputation will be ruined by this woman whos pretending to be a virgin
Of course they wont believe you without proof
If you make the accusation convincingly then my cunning wont fail me
Ill go now to find out the date of the wedding
Boy
Yes Signior
In my bedroom window there is a book
Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard
Im already here sir
I see that you are here but Id like you to go there and then come back again
I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe
I knew him when he wouldve walked ten miles to see a wellcrafted suit of armor now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket
Im not sure but I dont think so
I cant promise that love wont transform me but I can promise you this until I truly fall in love a woman will never make me act like such a fool
Ha
Look its the Prince and Mr Love
Ill hide in the arbor
Well should we hear some music
Yes my lord
Come on Balthasar lets hear that song again
Oh my good lord dont make me insult music again with my awful singing
Come on please sing
Just know this before I begin I cant play a single note thats worthy of note
Listen to him speaking in quarter notes
Thats a good song
And a bad singer my lord
Yes do you hear me Balthasar
Please get some excellent music because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window
Ill do the best I can my lord
Please do
Goodbye
Come here Leonato
What was it that you told me todaythat your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick
Oh yes
I didnt either
But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick whom she has always appeared to hate
Really my lord I dont know what to make of it but she loves him with such a passion that its past all understanding
Maybe shes just pretending
Yes thats quite likely
Oh God
Pretending
No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this then
Why what symptoms of love does she exhibit  
What symptoms my lord
She will have a seatyou heard my daughter tell you how
Yes she did tell us
Please please tell me
This is amazing
I would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love
I would have sworn that too my lord especially against Benedick
Has she told Benedick how she feels
No and she swears she never will
Thats whats driving her crazy
Its true Hero says so
My daughter told me everything
Now that you speak of paper I remember a funny story of Heros
Oh you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has Benedick and Beatrice written all over it
Yes thats the one
Oh she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her
Its true
If she wont tell Benedick someone else should
And what would that accomplish
Hell just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more
If he did that it would be a charitable deed to hang him
Shes an excellent sweet woman and theres no doubt that she is virtuous
And she is very smart
Oh my lord when wisdom and passion are in one body its ten to one that the passion will win
I am sorry for her as I should be since I am both her uncle and her guardian
I wish she were in love with me instead
I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife
Please tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say
Is that a good idea do you think
Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die for she says shell die if he doesnt love her and that shell die before she tells him and shell die if he woos her and shes made to hold back even one of her usual insults
Shes probably right
If she offers him her love its very possible that hell scorn it since as we all know he tends to be contemptuous
Hes a very proper man
And I swear to God hes very smart
He does indeed show sparks of something like wit
Its entirely possible
I can see you dont like this gentleman
No absolutely not
But please tell me whos his best friend
He spends most of his time with the good noble Claudio
Oh God Benedick will plague him like a disease
God help Claudio
If hes caught the Benedick hell lose all his money before hes cured
Im going to make sure I stay on your good side lady
Do that my friend
You will never fall victim to Benedicks charms my niece
No not until we see a hot January
Don Pedro is here
If he fears God he must necessarily keep the peace
If he breaks the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling
Well Im sorry for your niece
Should we go find Benedick and tell him about Beatrices love
Against my will Ive been told to bring you in to dinner
Lovely Beatrice I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that
I didnt take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me
If the job had been painful I would not have come
So you took pleasure in bringing me this message
Yes as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint
You dont want to eat sir
Goodbye then
Ha
Against my will Ive been told to bring you in to dinner Theres a double meaning in that
I didnt take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me Thats like saying Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying ‘thank you If this doesnt move me to take pity on her Im a horrible person
If I dont love her Im completely 
Margaret run into the sitting room
Youll find Beatrice there talking to Claudio and the Prince
Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that were talking all about her
Tell her you heard us and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun
She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation
This is your job
Do it well and then leave us
Ill make her come right away I promise you
All right Ursula as Beatrice arrives well be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick
Whenever I mention him praise him more than any man deserves
Itll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice
Lets start
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much
Thats what the Prince and my fiancé say
And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this madam
They did want me to tell her but I persuaded them that if they truly loved Benedick they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark
Why did you do that
Doesnt Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice
Whats the matter lieutenant
Ill beat him until the welts look like basketweave
Youll beat me
Are you talking you villain
No dont hit him lieutenant
Please sir restrain yourself
Let me go or Ill knock you on the head
Come on youre drunk
Drunk
No lieutenantGod gentlemenHelpLieutenantsir MontanoHelp menThe night guard is coming
Whos sounding that alarm
The whole town will riot
Youll be ashamed of this forever
What is the matter here
Ill kill him
Stop right now
Stop
Stop
The general is talking to you
Stop for Gods sake
For heavens sake stop this savage brawl
The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life because the instant he strikes he dies
Stop that alarm from ringing its scaring the islanders
Whats the matter here gentlemenHonest Iago you look upset
Answer me
I dont know
I dont
Id rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this
Youre famous for it
What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler
Tell me
Othello Ive been seriously hurt
I didnt do anything wrong that I know of unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me
All right now Im starting to lose my cool
Thats unbelievably bad
Iago who started it
Youre hitting close to home there
Id rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio
But I dont think itll hurt him to tell the truth
They were nearly killing each other as you saw when you pulled them apart
I cant tell you anything else
Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano who was only trying to help him but Im sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way and Cassio couldnt let it pass
Ill make you an example for the others to learn from
Whats the matter dear
Everythings fine now sweetheart
Are you hurt lieutenant
Yes but no doctor can help me
Oh I hope thats not true
You know Im powerful enough to make you pay for this
Please wait sir
Why are you talking about robbery
We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter
Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses
Your whole family will be ruined
What kind of crude jerk are you
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now
Youre a villain
Youre a senator
Youre going to pay for this Roderigo
I know who you are
Ill answer for everything
My reputation my reputation
Oh my reputation Iago my reputation
I swear I thought you meant youd been hurt physically
Your physical health matters more than your reputation
You havent lost it unless you think you have
There are lots of ways to get on the generals good side again
Go to him petition him
Drunk
Babbling senselessly
Squabbling
Swaggering
Ranting and raving to my own shadow
Oh wine is the devil
Who were you chasing with your sword
What did he do to you
I dont know
Is that possible
I remember a jumble of impressions but nothing distinctly
I remember a fight but not why we were fighting
Why do we party until were like animals
You seem all right now
How did you get better
One weakness led to another to make me hate myself
Come on youre being too hard on yourself
I wish none of this had happened given the situation here and your rank
But since this has happened you should fix it for your own good
Ill ask him for my position back again and hell tell me Im a drunk
Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths I wouldnt be able to answer that
I was a reasonable man then I became a fool and finally a beast
Oh how strange
Every glass of liquor is damned and the devils the main ingredient
Come on now wine is good for you if you know how to use it
Dont say anything bad about wine anymore
Lieutenant I think you know Im your friend
I know that sir
Imagine me a drunk
Any man can get drunk sometime
Ill tell you what to do
Othellos wife has a lot of influence now
Ask her to help you get back your position
She is so generous kind and ready to help that she thinks its wrong not to do everything she can even more than she is asked to do
Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you
Thats good advice
I believe it completely
Early in the morning Ill go visit Desdemona and plead my case
My situation is desperate
Youre doing the right thing
Good night lieutenant
Good night honest Iago
Who can say Im evil when my advice is so good
Thats really the best way to win the Moor back again
Its easy to get Desdemona on your side
Shes full of good intentions
How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly whatll do him good
When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces just like Im doing now
The more she
And thats how Ill turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all
Hello Roderigo
Ive spent most of my money and tonight I got beaten up
So with no money but a little more wisdom Im going back to Venice
Youre a poor man if youre this impatient
No it heals gradually
We achieve things with our intelligence not by magic and intelligent planning takes time
Arent things going well
My God its morning
All this excitement has made the time fly by
Go back to where youre staying and go to sleep
Go
Now two things still need to be done
Ill put her on that
Yes thats the way Ill do it
Ill pay you for your trouble
Are these wind instruments
Yes they are
Oh theres the problem
Whats the problem
Well well stop then
If youve got any music that cant be heard then play that
But as I said the general isnt really in the mood to hear music now
We dont have any music that cant be heard
Then pack up your instruments and go away
Go
Do you hear my friend
Please dont play games
CASSIO  Shes awake sir
If she feels like coming over here Ill give her your message
Good to see you Iago
You didnt go to sleep then
No
Im going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona
I humbly thank you
Even for a  Good morning lieutenant
Im sorry about what happened but Im sure everything will turn out all right
The general and his wife are talking about it now and shes defending you strongly
The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you
But he says he still loves and respects you and based on his own feelings alone hes looking for an opportunity to safely take you back
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona if you think thats all right
Please come in
Ill take you to a place where you can speak freely
Thank you very much
Iago give these letters to the ships captain who brought me here and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice
Now thats done Im going to walk on the fortification walls
I will my lord
Shall we go see this fortification men
Were at your service my lord
Ill do everything I can for you Cassio
Please do madam
Im sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before
Yes my lady
But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service especially if Im gone and someone else has my job
My husband will never get a moments rest Ill keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
But if you didnt know about it then you were wrong to get mad at us
Id never play pranks on you
If she is you can sue me for lying to you
Light the candles
Wake up my whole household
I dreamt about this
Give me some light
Its time for me to say goodbye to you
It would be inappropriatedangerous evenfor me to be seen working against the Moor as I would if I stayed
of patience
Im your advocate and Id rather die than give up on you
Madam here comes your husband
Madam Id better leave now
Why not stay and hear me talk to him
No madam
Im very uncomfortable and that wont help my case
Well do whatever you think best
Hey
I dont like that
What did you say
Nothing my lord or if I didI dont know what
Wasnt that Cassio leaving my wife
Cassio my lord
I really think it was him
Whats this my lord
I was talking to a petitioner here just now someone whos suffering from your anger
Who do you mean
Your lieutenant Cassio
Oh if Ive got any influence over you at all please patch things up with him
Please call him and tell him to come back here
Was that him just now
Yes
My love call him back in here
Not now my sweet Desdemona
Some other time
But will it be soon
Very soon because you want it
Will it be tonight at supper
No not tonight
Then tomorrow at dinner
Well then tomorrow night or Tuesday morning
Or Tuesday noon or at night or Wednesday morning
Please just name a time but dont wait more than three days
His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first placethough in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers
So when should he come
Tell me Othello
I swear I could do so much Please no more
I wont refuse you anything
This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when its cold outside or eat nutritious food or do something thats good for you
If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test itll be something difficult and terrible
I wont deny you anything
But in return please do one thing for me leave me alone for a little while
Would I ever deny you anything
No
Goodbye my husband
Goodbye my Desdemona
Ill come see you right away
God help me I love you
My noble lord What is it Iago
When you were wooing Desdemona did Michael Cassio know about it
Yes he knew about it the whole time
Why do you ask
Why are you curious Iago
I didnt realize he knew her
Oh really
Oh really
Yes really
Do you see something wrong with that
Isnt he an honest man
Honest my lord
Honest yes honest
As far as I know sir
What are you thinking
Thinking my lord
Thinking my lord My God you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud
Youre thinking something
Just a minute ago I heard you say you didnt like it when Cassio left my wife
What didnt you like
And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona you were like Oh really And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible
If youre my friend tell me what youre thinking
My lord you know Im your friend
I think you are
As for Michael Cassio I think it would be safe for me to swear that hes honest
I think so too
If theyre not honest they shouldnt look like they are
Absolutely people should be what they appear to be
In that case I think Cassios an honest man
No I think theres more to this than youre letting on
Please tell me what youre thinkingeven your worst suspicions
You want me to say what Im thinking
Youre not being a good friend Iago if you even  Please dont ask me to tell you
What are you talking about
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we havemen and women alike
If you steal my money youre just stealing trash
Its something its nothing its yours its mine and itll belong to thousands more
But if you steal my reputation youre robbing me of something that doesnt make you richer but makes me much poorer
Im going to find out what youre thinking
You cant find that out even if you held my heart in your hand you couldnt make me tell you
What
Beware of jealousy my lord
Its a greeneyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours
Oh what misery
The person whos poor and contented is rich enough
God help us not be jealous
Why are you telling me this
Do you think I would live a life of jealousy tormented by new suspicions every hour
No
If theres any doubt there is no doubt
If you say my wife is beautiful eats well loves good company speaks freely sings plays music and dances well youre not making me jealous
When a woman is virtuous talents like these just make her better
So please listen to me
Im not talking about proof yet
Watch out
I know the people of Venice well
They let God see things they wouldnt show their husbands
Do you really think so
Thats right she did
Well there you go
She was so young but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft
But Im sorry Ive blurted all this out
I beg your pardon for loving you too much
Im indebted to you forever
You seem a little depressed about this
Not at all not at all
Really Im afraid you are
I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you
But I see youre troubled
Please dont take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken
I wont
If you take it too seriously itll have bad effects that I didnt want it to have
Cassios a good friend of mineMy lord I can see youre upset
No not too upset
Goodbye goodbye
If you see anything else let me know
Tell your wife to watch her
Leave me alone now Iago
My lord Ill say goodbye now     
and affection even if its just an act
He and I will be there
Its true
Shes gone
The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness
Now Roderigo where did you see herOh that miserable wretchYou say you saw her with the MoorOh who would want to be a fatherHow did you know it was herTo think she tricked me so easilyWhat did she say to youGet me more candles and wake up all my relatives
Do you think theyre married
Yes I really think so
Oh heaven how did she get out
My own flesh and blood rebels against me
Fathers never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent
Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray
Have you ever heard of anything like that Roderigo
Yes sir I have
I think I can find him
giving it back to him
That will tell you a lot
But in the meantime just assume that Im paranoidas Im pretty sure I amand keep thinking shes innocent please
Dont worry about how I handle it
Ill say goodbye once more
This Iago is extremely honest and good and he knows a lot about human behavior
If it turns out that she really is running around on me Ill send her away even though itll break my heart
Oh what a curse marriage is
Id rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love sharing the rest of her with others
This is the plague of important menour wives betray us more than those of poor men
Its our destiny like death
We are destined to be betrayed when we are born
Oh here she comes
If shes cheated on me then heaven itself is a fake
I dont believe it
Whats going on Othello darling
The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you
Im sorry
Why are you whispering
Are you sick
I have a  Thats from lack of sleep
Itll go away
Let me wrap up your head and it will feel okay in less than an hour
Come on Ill escort you to dinner
Im very sorry youre not feeling well  
hundred times
But she loves it so much since Othello told her she should always keep it with her that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it
Ill copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago
Heaven knows what hes going to do with it
Whats going on
What are you doing here alone
Dont snap at me
Ive got something for you
Youve got something for me
Its a common  What
to have a stupid wife
Oh is that so
And what would you give me for the handkerchief
What handkerchief
What handkerchief
The one the Moor gave to Desdemona which you asked me to steal so many times
You stole it from her
She dropped it carelessly and seizing the opportunity since I was here I picked it up
Look here it is
Good girl give it to me
And what are you going to do with it
Whats it to you
If you dont need it for some important reason then give it back to me
Poor lady shell go crazy when she sees its missing
Now go leave me
The Moors mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions
Here he comes
No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night
Shes cheating on me
It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little
Whats with you my lord
I had no idea she was cheating on me
I never saw it or suspected it so it never hurt me
I slept well ate well and was happy
I never saw Cassios kisses on her lips
A man whos robbed but doesnt miss whats stolen isnt robbed at all
Im sorry to hear this
I wouldve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her the lowestranking grunts and all as long as I didnt know anything about it
Oh goodbye to my peace of mind
Goodbye to my happiness
Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great
Goodbye
Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums the flute and the splendid banners and all those proud displays and pageantry of war
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods goodbye
Othellos career is over
Is this possible my lord
Has it come to this
Show me or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt
Oh heaven help me
Arent you a rational human being
Dont you have any sense at all
Goodbye
What a horrible world we live in
Its not safe to be straightforward and honest
No stop
You should always be honest
I should always be wise
I swear I think my wifes faithful and I think shes not
I think youre trustworthy one minute and then not the next
I need proof
Her reputation was as pure as the snow but now its as dirty and black as my own face
As long as there are 
I see youre all eaten up with emotion
Im sorry I said anything
You want proof
Want
Yes I want it and Ill get it
But how
How will you get proof
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex
Death and damnation
Oh
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched
What can I say
What proof is there
Itd be impossible for you to watch them even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks
But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof we can get that
Give me one good reason to think shes cheating on me
I dont like what youre asking me to do
But since Ive gotten myself involved this far because Im so stupidly honest and because I like you so much Ill keep going
I recently shared a bed with Cassio and I couldnt sleep because of a raging toothache
Monstrous
No it was just a dream
Its a reason for suspicion even though its just a dream
And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy
Ill tear her to pieces
Just tell me this have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it
If its the same one If its the same one or any one that belongs to her then together with the other evidence its pretty strong
Oh Id kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could
Killing him once is not enough revenge
Now I see its true
My heart feels like its full of poisonous snakes
Be patient Im telling you
You may change your mind later
Never Iago
I swear to God Ill get revenge
Dont get up yet
Let heaven be my witnessIm putting my mind my heart and my hands in Othellos control
Let him command me and Ill do whatever he asks no matter how violent
I accept your devotion with my deepest love
Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassios dead
But let her live
Oh damn her damn her
Come away with me
Im going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil
Youre my lieutenant now
Im yours forever
Lead the way
Ill stop at every house
Ill reward you for your troubles
Why do you say that
Oh come on
Where does he sleep
Telling you where hes sleeping is like telling you where Im lying
What on earth does that mean
I dont know where hes staying so if I told you hes sleeping here or there Id be lying
Can you ask around and find out
Find him and tell him to come here
Tell him Ive spoken to my husband on his behalf and I think everything will be all right
I think I can do that
Where could I have lost that handkerchief Emilia
I dont know madam
Believe me Id rather have lost a purse full of gold coins
This would be enough to make my husband suspect me if he wasnt so free of jealousy
Hes not jealous
Who him
I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land
Look here he comes
I wont leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job backHow are you my lord
Hot hot and moist
With a hand like this you need to
fast and pray to stave off temptations
Its a nice hand an open one
But these days people give each other their hands without their hearts
I dont know about that
Now dont forget you promised me something
What did I promise my dear
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you
I have a bad cold thats bothering me
Lend me your handkerchief
Here my lord
No the one I gave you
I dont have it with me
You dont
No my lord
Thats not good
almost read peoples thoughts
She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her my father would love and desire her
When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married
I did
Is that possible
Yes its true
Theres magic in its fabric
A twohundredyearold witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance
The silk came from sacred silkworms and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins hearts
Really
Is that true
Its absolutely true so take good care of it
I wish I had never seen it
Ha
Why
Why are you yelling at me so angrily
Is it lost
Is it gone
Tell me is it missing
God help me
What do you have to say for yourself
Its not lost but what if it were
What do you mean
Im telling you its not lost
Please hire Cassio again
Bring me the handkerchiefMy mind is full of doubt
Come on
The handkerchief
Damn it
And you say hes not jealous
I never saw him like this before
Theyre like stomachs and were just the food
They eat us up hungrily and when theyre full they vomit us up
Look here comes Cassio and my husband
Theres no other way
Shes the one whos got to do it
Go ahead and ask her
Then I could stop wondering and find some other career
If his face changed as much as his personality has I wouldnt recognize him
God knows I have done my best to argue for you and made him angry at me for being so aggressive
Youll just have to be patient for a little while
Ill do what I can more than Id do for myself
Let that be enough for you
Is Othello angry
Can he even get angry
If hes angry there must be something seriously wrong
Please do so
There must be some political news from Venice or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood
Thats the way it goes
We shouldnt expect men to be perfect or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday
I hope to God its something political like you think and not jealousy involving you
Oh no
I never gave him reason to be jealous
But jealous people dont think like that
Theyre never jealous for a reason theyre just jealous
Its like a monster that just grows and grows out of nothing
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othellos mind
Amen to that lady
Ill go look for himCassio stay around here
If hes in a good mood Ill mention you again and do everything I can
I thank you lady
Hello Cassio
Why are you so far from home
How are you my pretty Bianca
To tell you the truth I was just going to your house
And I was just going to yours
Youve kept away from me for a week
Seven days and seven nights
A hundred and sixtyeight hours
And lovers hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones
What a tedious wait
Oh Cassio where did you get this
Has it come to this
Well well
Oh come on woman
Well whose is it
Its pretty
So Id like it copied
Take it and do that for me and leave me alone for a while
Leave you alone
Why
Im waiting here for the general and I dont want him to see me with a woman
And whys that
Its not because I dont love you
But you dont love me
Please just walk with me a little ways and tell me if Ill see you later tonight
I can only walk a little way with you since Im waiting here
But Ill see you soon
All right have it your way
I have to make do
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs
Its better that you didnt kill him
But he kept chattering so foolishly talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms that it was hard for me to restrain myself
But please tell me sir is your marriage  Let him do his worst
The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will
Do you really think so
What do you mean do I think so
What just because they kissed in private
An illicit kiss
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so but they didnt do anything
Naked in bed together but without doing anything
Come on Iago
As long as they didnt do anything it would only be a minor sin
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief Then what
Her reputation is also her own
Can she give that away too
But a handkerchief God I wish I could forget about the handkerchief
What you told me it haunts me like a nightmarehes got my handkerchief
Yes what about it
Thats not good
What if Id said I saw him do something to hurt you
Yes but hed deny it all
What did he say
He said he didI dont know
He was in bed with With her
With her on top of herhowever you want to say it
In bed with her
On top of her
My God its nauseating
Handkerchiefconfessionshandkerchief
Noses ears lips
Is it possible
This is the way to trick gullible fools
Hey Cassio
Whats the matter
This is his second fit like this
He had one yesterday
Rub his temples
No dont
If you interrupt it hell foam at the mouth and go crazy
Look hes moving
Why dont you go away for a bit
When he leaves its very important that I talk to you
What happened general
Did you hit your head
Are you making fun of me
I wish you could face your bad news like a man
Hes subhuman like an animal
Did he confess
Sir be a man
Your case is better than that
Then Ill know exactly what she is just as I know what I am
Youre wise
Thats for sure
While you were dazed by griefwhich isnt appropriate for a man like youCassio showed up here
I got him to leave and made up an excuse for your trance
I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit and he promised he would
Ill make him tell me the whole story againwhere how often how long agoand when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future
Im telling you just watch his face
But stay calm and dont get carried away by rage or Ill think youre not a man
Do you hear what Im saying Iago
Will you go hide
Now Ill ask Cassio about Bianca a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes
Thats the whores curse to seduce many men but to be seduced by one
Whenever he talks about her he cant stop laughing
And when he laughs Othello will go crazy
In his ignorant jealousy hell totally misunderstand Cassios smiles gestures and jokesHow are you lieutenant
The poor thing
Hes laughing already
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much
The poor thing I really think she loves me
Now he denies it a bit and tries to laugh it off
Have you heard this Cassio
Hes asking him to tell the story again
Go on tell it
She says youre going to marry her
Are you
Ha ha ha
Do you think youve won
Me marry her
That whore
Please give me a little credit
Im not that stupid
Ha ha ha
So so so so
Youre kidding
All right then
She thinks Ill marry her because she loves me
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer
Now hes telling the story
She was here just now
She hangs around me all the time
I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore and the fool showed up
Ha ha ha
Now hes saying how she took him into our bedroom
Look out here she comes
Damn you
What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief
I was an idiot to take it
You want me to copy the embroidery pattern
That was a likely story that you found it in your room and didnt know who it belonged to
This is a love token from some other slut and you want me to copy its pattern for you
What is it my dear Bianca
Whats wrong
My God thats my handkerchief
If you want to come have dinner with me you can
If you dont want to then good riddance
Go after her go
Actually I should
Will you be having dinner with her tonight
Yes I will
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her
Oh Iago
And did you see the handkerchief
Was it mine
It was yours I swear
And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him
She gave it to him and he gave it to his whore
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight
Oh shes a fine woman
A fair woman
A sweet woman
No you have to forget all that now
Yes let her die and rot and go to hell tonight
Oh the world never saw a sweeter creature
But thats not how youre going to be
Shes so good at sewing and a wonderful musician
Oh she could sing a wild bear to sleep
Oh shes so witty and creative
All the worse that she stooped this low then
Oh a thousand times worse a thousand timesand what a sweet personality she has
Yes a little too sweet
Yes thats for sure
Oh its dreadful dreadful Iago
If you still feel so affectionate toward her then why not give her permission to cheat on you
Ill chop her into pieces
Oh its horrible of her
Thats worse
Get me some poison tonight Iago
I wont argue with her so her beautiful body wont disarm meTonight Iago
Dont do it with poison
Strangle her in her bed the same bed shes contaminated
Good good I like thatits only fair
Very good
And let me kill Cassio
Youll hear more from me by midnight
Excellent good
Thats her father and his friends whove been roused out of bed
Youd better go inside
No I must let them find me
My good qualities my legal status as Desdemonas husband and my innocence will protect me
Is it them
I dont think so
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant
Hello everyone
Whats going on
He needs to see you right away
What do you think he wants
Something about Cyprus
I think its important
The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight one after the other and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Dukes already
Theyre very anxious for you to get there
When you werent at home the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you
Its good you found me
Ill just speak a word or two here in the house and then Ill go with you
Whats that trumpet for
I think someones coming from Venice
Look your wife is with him
Greetings good general
The duke and senators of Venice greet you
Whats new cousin Lodovico
Very nice to see you sir
Welcome to Cyprus
Thank you
How is lieutenant Cassio
Well hes alive
Are you sure of that
Excuse me  
He didnt say anything hes reading
So theres a rift between Othello and Cassio
Yes unfortunately
Id do anything to bring them back together since I really care for Cassio
Damn it all
Excuse me my lord
Are you in your right mind
Is he angry
I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place
Im happy about that
Oh are you really
My lord
Im glad youre insane enough to admit it in front of me
Why sweet Othello   I havent done anything to deserve this
My lord no one will believe this in Venice even though Id swear I saw it with my own eyes
That was too much
Shes crying
Oh you devil you devil
Get out of my sight
I wouldnt want to stay here and make you angry
Shes obedienta fine lady
Please my lord call her back
Madam
My lord
What do you want with her sir
Who me
See how well she can turn
She can turn and turn and then turn on you again
And she can cry siroh how she can cry
Very obedientkeep cryingConcerning thisoh what fake emotionI am being ordered homeGet away from me Ill send for you laterSir Ill obey the order and return to Venice
Cassio can have my job
And tonight sir I invite you have dinner with me
Welcome to Cyprus
Horny animals
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable
Hes changed a great deal
Is he sane
Is he losing his mind
He is what he is
I wont say anything negative about what he might be
If he isnt what he might be then I wish to God he were
Hitting his wife
Its true that wasnt such a nice thing to do
But I wish I could say thats the last time hell do it
Is it a habit of his
Or did the letter make him emotional somehow and this is the first time hes done it
Oh its too bad
It wouldnt be right for me to tell you everything Ive seen and heard
Just go after him and watch what he does next
Im sorry I was so wrong about him
You havent seen anything then
No and I didnt hear anything either or suspect anything at all
But youve seen her and Cassio together
Yes but I didnt see anything wrong and I heard every syllable they said
Didnt they ever whisper
Never my lord
Or ask you to leave the room
Never
Not even to get her fan or her gloves or her mask or anything
No my lord
Thats strange
Id swear to you on my soul that shes a good honest person sir
Tell her to come here
Go
She says all the right things but the dumbest brothelkeeper would tell the same story
Ive seen her do it
My lord what do you want
Please dear come here
What can I do for you
Let me see your eyes
Look at my face
What horrible thing are you imagining
I can tell youre furious but I dont understand what youre saying
Go ahead swear to that so youll be damned to hell for lying
Heaven knows I am
Heaven knows youre as unfaithful as hell
Unfaithful my lord
With whom
How am I unfaithful
Leave me alone Desdemona go away
Because of me
If youve been ordered back to Venice because of my father dont blame me
You may have lost his respect but so have I
Even that I could put up with
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from has rejected me
Worse than that shes polluted herself so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce
Even the goddess of patience couldnt look at this and be patientits too horrifying
I hope you think Im faithful to you
As faithful as flies in rotting meat which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows
Oh I wish youd never been born
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore
What have you done
What have you done
Oh you streetwalker
What have you done
You brazen whore
I swear to God youre accusing me wrongly
So youre saying youre not a whore
No Im as honest as I am Christian
What youre not a whore
No I swear it
Is that possible
Oh heaven help us
I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married OthelloYou whorehousekeeper
You
Weve finished our business
Heres some money for you
Please lock the door and keep quiet
Whats he talking about
How are you madam
Ensign whats he doing in there
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship
If he can keep it hell be set forever
I dont understand
Hes married
To whom
Here comes another group looking for you
Its Brabantio
He intends to do something bad to you
Hey
Stop right there
Sir its the Moor
Get him hes a thief
With who
I dont have a lord
Dont talk to me Emilia
Things have certainly changed
Its fair for him to treat me like this very fair
What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about
What can I do for you madam
How are you
I dont know
When grownups teach little children they do it gently and easily
He might have treated me like that because Im as unused to abuse as a little child
Whats the matter lady
He called her a whore so many times and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people cant stand to hear it
Am I that name Iago
What name madam
What my lord said I was
Why did he do that
I dont know
I just know Im not one
Dont cry dont cry
What a day this is
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen give up her father and country and friends just to be called a whore
Doesnt that make you want to cry
Its just my bad luck
Damn him
How did he get such an idea
Heaven knows
I bet my life some evil busybody some meddling lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position
I bet my life on it
Nobodys that bad
Its impossible
If there is then heaven help him
Why should he call her a whore
Whos been with her
The Moor is being tricked by some crook some terrible villain some rotten bastard
Oh I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with
Keep your voice down
Oh to hell with those people
Its the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect Id cheated on you with the Moor
Youre a fool
Shut up
Oh God Iago what can I do to win my husband back again
Please go to him my friend
I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me
Here Im kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me either by thoughts or actions or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else or if I never did love him or dont love him noweven though he tries to shake me off
then I hope I have a life of misery
Unkindness is powerful and his unkindness may kill me but itll never destroy my love
I cant say whore It makes me sick to say the word even now
Political business is bothering him and hes just taking it out on you
If only that were all it is It is I promise
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner
The Venetians are waiting for their food
Go in and dont cry
Everything will be all right
How are you Roderigo
I dont think youre treating me fairly
What makes you say that
Well I wont take it any longer
Will you listen to me Roderigo
Your words and actions dont match up
Thats not fair
Its the truth
The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona wouldve made even a nun want to sleep with me
You told me she got them and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon but nothing like that ever happens
Well all right then
Fine
Fine he says
All right Its not fine and Im not all right
Its wrong and Im starting to realize Im being cheated
Okay
Its not okay
Im going to tell Desdemona my feelings
If she returns my jewels Ill stop pursuing her and apologize to her
If not Ill challenge you to a duel
Youve said what you have to say now
Yes and Ill do everything I just said
From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before
Give me your hand Roderigo
Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable but I still insist Ive done everything I could to help you
It doesnt look that way to me
I admit it doesnt look that way to me and the fact that you suspect me shows that youre smart
But Roderigo if youre as courageous and determined as I think you are then wait just a bit longer
If youre not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me
Well whats your plan
Is it feasible
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus
Is that true
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice
What do you mean get rid of him
I mean knock his brains out so he cant take Othellos place
And thats what you want me to do
Yes if you want to help yourself
Hes having dinner tonight with a prostitute and Ill go visit him
He doesnt know hes been appointed governor yet
When you see him walking by here as Ill make sure he does between twelve and one you can nab him
Ill be nearby to help you and between the two of us we can handle him
Ill give you such reasons for killing him that youll feel obliged to snuff him out
Its nearly dinner time and the nights going to be wasted
Lets go
I want to hear more about this
You will
Please sir dont trouble yourself
Good night madam
Thank you
Youre most welcome
Would you walk out with me sirOh Desdemona Yes my lord
Go to bed right this minute
Ill be there shortly
I will my lord
How are things now
He looks calmer than he did before
Send me away
Thats what he said
So give me my nightgown Emilia and Ill say goodnight
We shouldnt displease him
Yes
I wish youd never met him
Thats not what I wish
I love him even when hes harsh and meanHelp me unpin this would youI love even his stubbornness his frowns his bad moods
I put those wedding sheets on your bed as you asked
It doesnt matter
Oh how silly we are
If I die before you do make sure Im wrapped in those sheets in my coffin
Listen to you
Dont be silly
She knew an old song called Willow that reminded her of her own story and she died singing it
I cant get that song out of my head tonight
Its all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary
Please hurry up
Should I get your nightgown
No just help me unpin this
That Lodovico is a goodlooking man
Hes very handsome
He speaks well
I know a lady in Venice whod walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him
Its the wind
My eyes itchis that an omen Ill be crying soon
No it doesnt mean anything
I heard someone say thats what it means
Oh these men these men
Do you honestly thinktell me Emiliathere are women whod cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner
There are women like that out there no question
You Roderigo
Come on Ill fight you
Sir your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do
You evil thief where have you hidden my daughter
You devil youve put a spell on her
Its obvious to everyone that youve tricked her drugged her or kidnapped her
If he struggles use force
Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world
Why wouldnt you
By the light of heaven no I would not
I wouldnt either by daylight
It would be easier to do it in the dark
Could you really do such a thing for all the world
The worlds huge
Its a big prize for such a small sin
I dont think you would
Actually I think I would and then Id undo it after I did it
I wouldnt do it for a nice ring or fine linen or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats
But for the whole world
Who wouldnt cheat on her husband to make him king
Id risk my soul for that
Id never do such a bad thing not for the whole world
Why a bad action is just a wrong in this world but when youve won the whole world its a wrong in your own world so you can make it right then
I dont think any woman like that exists
Yes a dozen of themas many as there are women in the world in fact
But I do think its the husbands fault if we wives cheat on them
For instance our husbands
We have feelings
Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too
They see smell and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands
I think they do
Is it out of lust
I think so
Is it a weakness
It is
And dont we have passions and a taste for fun and weaknesses just like men
Then tell them to treat us well
Good night good night
I pray that God will let me learn from women like thatnot to follow their bad example but to avoid it
Here stand behind this wall hell come right away
Quick quick
Dont be afraid
Ill be right next to you
This will either make us or break us
Im right behind you
Be bold and get ready
I dont really want to do this but hes given me good reasons

Damned Iago

Killing men in the dark
Where are these murderers
Are you good or evil
Judge for yourself
Signor Lodovico
Thats me
I beg your pardon

Whats the matter
Whos shouting

Oh my dear Cassio
My sweet Cassio
Oh Cassio Cassio Cassio
You notorious whore
Cassio do you know who might have stabbed you like this
No
Im sorry to find you like this
Ive been looking all over for you
Hes fainted
Oh Cassio Cassio Cassio
Sir I believe this piece of trash Bianca has something to do with all this troubleHang in there CassioCome here bring the light
Do you recognize this face
Thats the one sir
Do you know him
Know him
Yes
Im glad to see you
How are you doing CassioSomeone bring me a stretcher
Roderigo
Its him its him
Goodheres the stretcher
Get somebody strong to carry him out of here
Ill get the generals surgeon
There wasnt any problem
I dont even know him
Keep an eye on her
Do you see
The guilty speak volumes even when theyre silent
Whats the matter
Whats the matter husband
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped
Hes near death and Roderigos dead already
Oh no good gentleman
Oh no good Cassio
This is what happens when you visit whores
Please Emilia ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight
He ate at my house but that doesnt make me nervous
Oh did he
I order you to come with me
Go to hell you whore
As moral as me
Damn you
Gentlemen lets go make sure Cassios wounds are properly dressedCome on maam you can tell us another story
Emilia go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happenedWill you please go now 
To prison until youre called into court
His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately on pressing state business
Its true
The Dukes in a meeting right now and hes sent for you too
The Dukes in a meeting
At this time of night
Bring him with us
The laws on my side
The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own
If we let crimes like this happen slaves and heathens will be our rulers
I have to do it I have to do it
But I wont shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble
But shes got to die or shell cheat on other men
Put out the light of the candle and then put out the light of her heart
If I extinguish the candle I can light it again if I regret it
When Ive plucked this rose I cant make it grow again it will have no choice but to wither and die
Whos there
Othello
Yes Desdemona
Will you come to bed my lord
Yes my lord
Oh my lord what do you mean by that
Be quick about it
Ill wait over here
I dont want to kill you before youve readied your soul
No I dont want to send your soul to hell when I kill you
Youre talking about killing
Yes I am
Then heaven have mercy on me
Amen to that from the bottom of my heart
If you really feel that way then I hope you wont kill me
Hmmph
I dont know why I should be afraid since I havent done anything wrong
But Im still afraid
Think of your sins
My only sin was loving you too much
Yes thats why you have to die
Youre wrong to kill me for loving you
Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that
Youre shaking with emotion
These are bad omens but I hope I hope they dont predict my future
I will
Whats this all about
You gave that handkerchief the one I loved and gave to you to Cassio
No I swear by my life and soul
Bring him here and ask him
Youre on your deathbed
But Im not dying yet
Yes right now
So confess your sin freely now
Youre going to die
Then heaven have mercy on me
Amen to that
And you have mercy on me too
I never gave him any token of romantic love
I saw him holding the handkerchief
You liar youre turning my heart to stone and making me call what Ill do murder when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice
I saw the handkerchief
Hes already done so
What my lord
That he had sex with you
What
Yes
He wouldnt say that
No
Honest Iagos arranged that
What is he dead
If he had as many lives as hes got hairs on his head I wouldve killed them all in revenge
Oh hes been betrayed and Ive been ruined
Send me away my lord but dont kill me
Kill me tomorrowbut let me live tonight
No if you struggle with me Just half an hour
Just let me say one prayer
Its too late
Whats that noise
Arent you dead yet
Whos there  
Yes its Emilia
Whats the matter with you now
Yes just now my lord
Cassios killed a young Venetian named Roderigo
Roderigos been killed
And Cassios killed
No Cassio wasnt killed
Cassios not dead
Then the wrong man is dead and sweet revenge has gone wrong
Oh Ive been murdered unfairly
Oh Lord whos that crying
That
What
Oh no that was my ladys voice
Help
Help
Oh lady speak again
Sweet Desdemona
Oh sweet mistress speak
Im dying an innocent woman
Oh who did this thing
No one
I did it myself
Give my love to my kind husband
Oh goodbye
Why how could she have been murdered
My God who knows
You heard her say it wasnt me
Yes she said that
I must go report what happened
She was lying even as she was going down to hell
I did kill her
Then she was even more an angel and youre an even blacker devil
She cheated on me and she was a whore
You slander her you devil
She was fickle and unfaithful like water
She was utterly true to you
Ask your husband if you doubt me
If I didnt have a good reason to do this damn me to the very bottom of hell
Your husband knew about everything
My husband
Your husband
He said she was unfaithful
Yes with Cassio
If shed been faithful to me I never would have given her up not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her
My husband
Yes hes the one who first told me about her
Hes an honest man who detests evil actions
My husband
Why do you keep repeating that woman
Im telling you your husband
Oh my mistress a villain has made a mockery of your love
My husband said she was unfaithful
Yes him woman
I said your husbandDo you understand that word
My friend your husband the honest honest Iago
If he said that then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever
Hes lying through his teeth
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that
Ha
Go ahead do your worst
You werent good enough for her
Youd better shut up
Oh you idiot
You stupid fool
As dumb as dirt
Ill tell everyone what you did even if it
The Moors killed my mistress
Murder murder
Whats the matter
Whats going on here general
Oh are you here Iago
Youve done a good job that other men can attribute their murders to you
Whats the matter
I told him what I thought
But did you tell him she cheated on him
I did
Then you told a lie a sick wicked lie
I swear on my soul it was a lie
You said she slept with Cassio
Did you say Cassio
Yes with Cassio
Now be quiet
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed No heaven forbid
You cant trust them
Its true theyre inconsistent
My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships
And mine say a hundred and forty
And mine say two hundred
But often in these cases reports are just estimates
Yes we get the idea
Its a messenger from the warships
And your lies caused this murder
Ill kill myself out of grief
Oh evil evil
Are you crazy
Im ordering you go home
Good gentlemen give me permission to speak
I know I ought to obey my husband but not now
Maybe Ill never go home again Iago
Oh
Oh
Oh
Yes go ahead and moan because you killed the sweetest most innocent woman who ever lived
She was filthy
Im glad your father isnt alive to see this
him terribly
It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell
Its sad but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times
Damn it shut your mouth
Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up
If youre smart youll go home
I wont
Shame on you
Drawing your sword on a woman
Oh you stupid Moor
I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband
Hed begged me to steal it many times
You evil whore
You think she gave it to Cassio
No I found it and gave it to my husband
You piece of filth youre lying
I swear Im not lying
You absolute villain
Hes killed his wife
Yes yes
Lay me next to my mistress
Hes gone and his wifes dead
Kill him rather than let him leave this room
But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did
Let it all go
What did your song mean lady
Can you hear me
Ill die like a swan
They sing when they die
Here it is
Uncle Im coming out
Look in on me and talk with me or Ill attack even without a weapon
Whats the matter
Look I have a weapon the best sword a soldier could have
Ive fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon
But
who can control his fate
Im not like that now
Dont be afraid even though you see me with a weapon
This is the end of my journey the end of my life
Are you backing away in fear
Theres no reason to be afraid
Where would Othello goOh look at you
Youre as pale as your nightgown
When we meet on Judgment Day that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell where devils will grab me
Youre cold cold and you were never hot with lust
Oh you damned villain
Whip me you devils so I dont have to look at this heavenly sight
Where is that poor rash man
You mean the man who used to be Othello
Here I am
Wheres that snake
Bring the villain forward
I dont like it that you knew about this Iago
Damn it youre not listening to me
You told me you hated him
I do hate 
But thats just a fairy tale
If you are a devil I wont be able to kill you
Take his sword away from him
Im bleeding but you didnt kill me
Im not sorry either
I want you to live since to me death is happiness
Say anything
This poor guys partly confessed his plan
Did you plan Cassios death with him
Yes
Dear general I never gave you any reason to hate me
I believe you and I ask you to forgive me
Will you please make this halfdevil say why he tricked me and damned my soul
Dont ask me anything
You know what you know
From this moment on Ill never say another word
What not even to pray
Well do your best
This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio
Oh you villain
Ungodly and monstrous
Oh you wicked scoundrel
Cassio how did you get my wifes handkerchief
I found it in my room and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes
Youre stripped of your power and your command and Cassio will govern Cyprus
As for this slave Iago if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time hell have it
Youll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian governmentOkay take him away
But enough about that
When you record these sad events in your letters please describe me exactly as I am
Dont tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility
If youre being fair youll have to describe me as someone who loved too much but who wasnt wise about it
Write all this
down and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this
Oh what a bloody end to all this
Everything weve heard is bad
I was afraid this would happen because he was a noble brave man but I didnt think he had a weapon  
What do you think about this change
They cant have changed theres no way this could be true
Its a trick to confuse us
Heres some more news coming in
Thats just what I thought
How many can you guess
Thirty ships
Now theyve turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus
Signor Montano your brave and loyal servant gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him
Then its certain theyre heading for Cyprus
Is Marcus Luccicos in town
No hes in Florence
Write to him immediately
Hurry
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor
Forgive me your grace
Why whats the matter
Its my daughter
Oh my daughter
Is she dead
Shes dead to me
And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit and impose the death penalty if you choose to even if the criminal were my own son
I humbly thank you sir
Were sorry to hear this
Nothing but this is true
Theres nothing more
Im awkward in my speech and Im not a smooth talker
She blushes at the slightest thing
The devil must be behind this
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her
Tell us Othello
Or did you agree to this as equals
of her father
Bring Desdemona here
You know where she is
In the meantime Ill tell you all as honestly as I confess my sins to God how I wooed this beautiful lady and how she came to love me
Tell us Othello
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often continually asking me about my life and all the battles Ive fought
When I talked about all these things Desdemona used to listen attentively
She said she wished she hadnt heard it but she also wished there was a man like me for her
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell shed fall in love with him
I took the hint and spoke to her
She said she loved me for the dangers Id survived and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me
Thats the only witchcraft I ever used
Here comes my wife now
Shell confirm everything
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over
Please let her speak
If she admits she wanted this then I wont blame OthelloCome here my child
Who do you obey here
Father this isnt easy for me
Im torn
Youre the one I have to obey
Im your daughter
Im finished then
Duke please go ahead with your state business
Id rather adopt a child than have one of my ownCome here Moor
With all my heart I give you that thing which if you didnt already have it Id try with all my heart to keep from you
You would have made me treat them like a tyrantIm done my lord
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers if you cant change something dont cry about it
Please Im asking you go ahead and get back to your state affairs
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet
She can stay at her fathers house
I wont allow it
Neither will I
Dear Duke please listen to what I have to say
What do you want to do Desdemona
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him
I saw Othellos true face when I saw his mind
Let me go with him
Please allow her to do this
You can decide that privately
Whats important is the urgency of this mission
Youll have to leave tonight
With all my heart Ill go right away
Well meet again at nine in the morning
Othello have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you
Hell accompany my wife and bring whatever else you think I might need
which any peacelover can do
His military understanding is all theory no practice
And theres nothing I can do about it
Thats the curse of military service
Now you tell me should I feel loyal to the Moor
If you dont like him you should quit
No calm down
Im serving under him to take advantage of him
We cant all be masters and not all masters should be followed
Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food and then when they get old theyre terminated
They ought to be whipped for being so stupid
Let me tell
All right then
Treat Desdemona well
Keep an eye on her Moor
She lied to me and she may lie to you
Iago Im leaving my dear Desdemona with you
Have your wife attend to her and bring them along as soon as you can
Come on Desdemona Ive only got an hour of love to spend with you to tell you what you need to do
Were on a tight schedule
Iago
What do you have to say noble friend
What do you think I should do
Go to bed and sleep
Im going to go drown myself
If you do that Ill never respect you again
Why you silly man
Oh how stupid
Ive been alive for twentyeight years and Ive never met a man who knew what was good for him
Id rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I cant have
What should I do
I know its foolish to be so much in love but I cant help it
Cant help it
Nonsense
What we are is up to us
Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener
Depending on what we plantweeds or lettuce or one kind of herb rather than a variety the garden will either be barren and useless or rich and productive
If we didnt have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires our bodily urges would take over
Thankfully we have reason to cool our raging lusts
I dont believe it
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower
Come on be a man
Drown yourself
Drowning is for cats or blind puppiesdont drown yourself
Ive told you Im your friend and Ill stick by you 
Ive never been more useful to you than I will be now
Heres what youll do
Moors are moody peopleSo sell your lands and raise a lot of cash
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter
Shell have to have it
So have your money ready
If you want to go to hell there are better ways to do it than killing yourself
Raise all the money you can
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl
And to hell with drowning yourself
Thats completely beside the point
You can trust me
Go now and get cash
I told you before and Ill tell you again and again I hate the Moor
So lets join forces and get revenge
Go get money
Well speak again tomorrow
Goodbye
Where will we meet in the morning
At my house
Ill be there early
No more talk about killing yourself okay
Ive changed my mind about that
Go then goodbye
Put a lot of cash together
Im going to sell all my land
Thats how I always do it getting money from fools
Id be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldnt get something useful out of him
I hate the Moor and theres a widespread rumor that hes slept with my wife
Im not sure its true but just the suspicion is enough for me
He thinks highly of me
Cassios a handsome man
Lets see how can I
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time
How
How
Lets see
Ive worked it out
What can you see out on the ocean
Nothing
It was windy on shore too
A big blast of wind shook our fortifications
What do you think will be the result of this storm
The Turkish navy will be broken up
The winds whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky
Ive never seen the waters so disturbed
If the Turkish fleet isnt protected in some harbor their men must all be drowned
No ship could survive this storm
Ive got news boys the wars over
This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined
One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked
What
Is this true
Michael Cassio lieutenant of the Moor Othello has arrived on shore
The Moor himself is still at sea
Im happy about that
Hell be a good governor
The two of them were separated during the storm
I hope to God Othellos all right
Lets do that
Every minute we expect more ships to arrive
Thanks you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello
I hope heaven protects him from the weather because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea
Is his ship sturdy
Yes its well built and the ships pilot is very expert and experienced
Whats all that shouting about
Please go find out for certain who has arrived
Ill do that
Good lieutenant is your general married
A man named Iago the generals ensign
Whos that
Look the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore
We should all kneel before her men of Cyprus
Greetings my lady and may God always be with you
Thank you brave Cassio
Is there any news about my husband
He hasnt arrived yet
As far as I know hes okay and will arrive here soon
Oh but Im worried
How did you two get separated
The storm separated us
Go find out the news
you as sure as your names Roderigo if I were the Moor I wouldnt want to be Iago
Im not who I appear to be
Do it and shout like the citys on fire
Hey Brabantio
Signor Brabantio hey
Thieves
Thieves
Check on your daughter your house your money
Thieves
Thieves
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me youd be sick of her by now
Shes always talking when I want to sleep
I admit that in front of you my lady she keeps a bit quiet
You have no reason to say that
Come on come on
In your own kitchens you act like wildcats
Shame on you you slanderer
No its true or if its not Im a villain
You wake up to have fun and you start work when you go to bed
No I dont
But if you had to say something nice about me what would you say
Dont make me do it my lady
Im critical by nature
Yes madam
Im not as happy as I seem
Come on what would you say about me
Very clever
Even if shes ugly shell be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her
This is getting worse and worse
What if shes pretty but stupid
You dont know a thing
You give your best praise to the worst women
But how would you praise a truly good woman someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her
A woman who was beautiful but never proud who could speak well but knew when to be quiet who dressed well but was never overdressed who had selfrestraint even when she could get what she wanted a woman who never took revenge who overlooked it when people hurt her who was too wise to do anything stupid who could think without revealing her thoughts and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her that kind of woman if she ever existed would Would do what
Would raise babies and clip coupons
Oh thats pathetic
Dont listen to him Emilia even though hes your husband
What do you think about him Cassio
Isnt he a horrible man
He speaks bluntly madam
Hes more of a soldier than a wise man  
I recognize his trumpet
Yes it is
Lets go greet him when he lands
Look here he comes
My beautiful warrior
My darling Othello
Im amazed you got here before me
But Im overjoyed
If I died right now Id be completely happy since Ill probably never be as happy as this again in my life
God willing our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older
Amen to that
I cant talk about my happiness anymore
Its too much
Lets go up to the castle
Good news friends
The wars over and the Turks are drowned
How are my old friends from this island doingHoney theyll love you here in Cyprus
And bring the ships captain to the castle
Hes a good manLets go Desdemona
Meet me down at the harborCome here
Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight
But first I have to tell you that Desdemonas completely in love with him
With Cassio
Thats impossible
Be quiet and listen to me
Othello isnt any of those things
Now if thats trueand its obviously truewhos in a better position than Cassio
Besides hes young and handsome and hes got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for
I cant believe that
Shes very moral
Like hell she is
If she were so moral she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place
Good lord
Did you see that
They were lusting after each other
Disgusting
But listen to me let me guide you
I brought you here from Venice
Be on guard duty tonight
Cassio doesnt know you
Ill be nearby
Make Cassio angry somehow either by speaking too loud or insulting his military skills or however else you want
All right
Hes hottempered and he might try to hit you with his staff
Try to get him to do that
To get what you want you need to get Cassio out of the way
Ill do it if you help me out
I promise I will
Meet me in a little while at the citadel
I need to get Othellos things from the ship
Goodbye
Goodbye
I wont be satisfied until I get even with him wife for wife
If I cant do that I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he cant think straight
For besides the good news we are also celebrating his marriage
Thats the end of the announcement
There will be a feast from five oclock until eleven
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello
Iagos a good man
Goodnight Michael
Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you canCome with me my dear love
Good night everyone
Hello Iago
Its time for us to stand guard
The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with DesdemonaI cant blame him
Whats the reason for this horrible shouting
Whats the matter
Sir is everyone in your family at home
Are your doors locked
Why are you asking me that
For Gods sake sir youve been robbed
Your hearts going to break
Its like half your souls been ripped out
At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb
Wake up wake up ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens
Get up I tell you
Are you crazy
Do you recognize my voice noble lord
Not me
Who are you
My names Roderigo
I told you not to hang around my house
Ive already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you
Sir sir sir
Yes shes young and tender
Like an invitation
But shes modest and ladylike too
And when she speaks doesnt her voice stir up passion
Shes a perfect woman its true
Well good luck to them tonight in bed
Not tonight Iago
Im not much of a drinker
I wish there was less social pressure to drink
Oh but these are our friends
Just one glass
Ill do most of the drinking for you
Ive already had a glass of wine tonight watered down but look how drunk I am
What are you talking about man
Tonight is for celebrating
Where are they
By the door
Please invite them in
Ill do it but I dont like it
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what hes drunk already hell be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog
Now Ill get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island
Here they come
If the future turns out as I hope it will Im all set for success
My God theyve given me a lot to drink
No it was a little one not more than a pint
Bring in more wine              
My God what a great song
I learned it in England where they have a talent for drinking
The Danes the Germans and the Dutchcome on drink drinkare nothing compared to the English
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers
They drink Danes under the table and it takes them no effort at all to outdrink Germans
Lets drink to our general
Ill drink as much as you do
Oh sweet England
God that songs even better than the other one
Do you want to hear it again
No because we shouldnt be doing thatstuff
Oh well Gods in charge and some people have to go to heaven while other people have to go to hell
Thats true lieutenant
Speaking for myselfand no offense to the general or anyone elseI hope Im going to heaven
Me too lieutenant
Okay but please not before me
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign
But lets stop this drinking and get down to businessGod forgive our sinsGentlemen lets get down to business
By the way I dont want anyone thinking Im drunk
Im not drunk
I can stand well enough and I can speak just fine
Yes youre speaking very well
Yes very well
So dont think that Im drunk
Its too bad
But is he often like this
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep
Hed stay up all night and all day if he didnt drink himself to sleep
The general should be informed about this
Dont you think so
And its too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deeprooted drinking problem as his secondincommand
We should definitely say something to the Moor
Well
Now Ive done a good days work
You must all keep up this united front
Dont simply hide your hatred
Swear your love for each other
On my honor I swear I love Rivers with all my heart
And I love Hastings with all my heart
Take my hand Hastings
Dorset embrace HastingsHastings express your affection for the marquess of Dorset
I swear I will never break this promise of love
And so do I my lord
Now noble Buckingham seal this alliance by embracing my wifes friends and make me happy in your unity
Noble Buckingham your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart
And just in time here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe
Good morning to my sovereign king and queen
Happy indeed the way we have spent the day
What blessed work my king
I hate it and want all good mens love
Today shall always be remembered as a holy day
If only all struggles ended this well
Please pardon our brother Clarence
Why madam have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king
Who doesnt know that the good duke is dead
Who doesnt know hes dead
Who says he is
Oh my God what a terrible world this is
Do I look as pale as everyone else does Lord Dorset
Is Clarence dead
But I reversed the death sentence
Well the poor man died by your first order which was carried by a winged messenger
Some tardy cripple must have taken the counterorder who came after Clarence was already buried
Its clear that someone less noble less loyal more bloodyminded than Clarence but not a blood relation deserves as bad an end as my brother but he goes free
Please be quiet
My soul is full of sorrow
I will not rise until your Highness hears me
Then hurry up and tell me what you want
That you lift the death sentence on my servant who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk
We know you have a job to do Brakenbury and well do what you say
Farewell brother
It doesnt make either of us happy I know
Well your imprisonment wont last long
I will either get you out lying if I have to or stay in prison in your place
In the meantime be patient
I have no choice
Goodbye
Go walk the path that you will never return from
I love you so much that Ill send your soul to heaven very soonif heaven will accept anything from me that is
But whos coming
Good afternoon my dear lord
The same to you my lord
Welcome to the open air again
How did you tolerate prison
But his punishment was bitter death
Who pleaded with me to pardon 
This is what happens when you act rashly
Did you notice how the queens guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about Clarences death
Oh they continually urged the king to do it
God will revenge it
But come lords will you come with me to Edwards room to comfort him
Well come with you your Grace
Tell me good grandmother is our father dead
No boy
My pretty children both of you misunderstand me
So youre admitting Clarence my father is dead
My uncle the king is to blame for this
God will take revenge
And so will I
Quiet children quiet
The king loves you very much
Innocent sweethearts you have no idea whos responsible for your fathers death
You think my uncle was lying grandmother
Yes boy
I cant believe that
Whats that noise
I plan to fall into the blackest despair
Why are the branches still living when the root is gone
Why arent the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up
If you do intend to live then mourn
If youre going to die be quick about it so you can catch the kings departing soul or follow him like obedient subjects to his new kingdom of endless night
Since your woes are only a portion of mine I have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own
I could drown the world
My poor husband my dear Edward
Our poor father Clarence
My sons Edward and Clarence
What support did I have other than Edward
And now hes gone
What support did we have besides our father
And now hes gone
And now theyre both gone
There has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me
There have never been orphans whove suffered what we have
There was never a mother who suffered so much loss
Alas I am the mother of all these others griefs
She weeps for Edward and so do I while she does not weep for Clarence though I do
These young children cry for Clarence and so do I though they dont cry for Edward as I do
Be a careful mother madam and think about your son the young prince
Your peace of mind depends on him
Sister calm down
All of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king
On my knee I humbly ask your blessing
God bless you and make you obedient loving and kind  
You mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief now its time to cheer each other up with love
Though we have lost a generous king we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king
We must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again
I think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from Wales and bring him to London to be crowned our king
Why only a few courtiers my lord of Buckingham
The king made peace among all of us
And so do I I think we all do
So I agree with noble Buckinghamonly a few should go to meet the prince
I think so too
For Gods sake my lord lets be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince
Along the way Ill find an opportunity to separate him from the queens proud relatives as step one in the plan weve discussed
You are my other self my oracle my prophet my dear brother
Good morrow neighbor whither away so fast
Im telling you I hardly know myself
Did you hear the news thats going around
Yes that the king is dead
Neighbors hello
Good day to you sir
Is it true that good King Edward has died
Yes sir its all too true God help us
Then gentlemen we can count on trouble
No no with Gods help his son will be king
Its bad news when a country is ruled by a child
His counselors will govern as long as hes a minor and then hell take over
With patience noble lord as prisoners must
Its a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please
Whats the news abroad
Very sad
Where is he in his bed
He is
You go ahead and I will follow you
Thats how it was with Henry the Sixth who was crowned in Paris when he was only nine months old
Really
It would be better if they were all on his fathers side or that there were none at all on his fathers side
Richard the duke of Gloucester is very dangerous and the queens sons and brothers are haughty and proudit would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects not rulers
Come come were worrying about the worstcase scenario
Im sure everything will be fine
When storms arrive early you can expect the harvest will be damaged
So if all turns out fine as you say its more than we deserve or I expect
Its always like this in times of change
But leave it all to God
Where are you all off to
The court has sent for us
Theyll be here tomorrow or the next day
Im dying to see the prince
I hope hes grown a lot since I last saw him
Yes mother but I wish I hadnt
Why dear child
Its good to grow
Yes said my uncle Gloucester Small plants are graceful while ugly weeds grow fast And since then Ive wished I wouldnt grow so fast because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry
Well it certainly wasnt true for Richard
As a child he took such a long time to grow up that according to his rule he should have grown up into a gracious adult
And no doubt he is gracious madam
I hope he is but mothers get to have their doubts
Hey if Id remembered something about him I could have had a good comeback for my uncle touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine
What would you have said my young York
Do tell
Indeed they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old
It took me two years before I had a single tooth
Grandmother this would have been a biting joke
Pretty York who told you about his teeth
His nurse grandmother
His nurse
Why she was dead before you were even born
Well if it wasnt her I dont know
A mischievous child
Come come you are too clever for your own good
Good lady dont be angry with the child
Little pitchers have big ears
Here comes a messenger
Whats the news
My lord its news I wish I didnt have to report
Hows the prince
Hes fine and healthy madam
What is your news
The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham
What did they do wrong
Ive told you everything I know
Why the nobles were imprisoned and on what charges I dont know my gracious lord
Oh no
I see the downfall of my family
Welcome destruction blood and massacre
My husband lost his life to get the crown and my sons fortunes have been tossed up and down leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses
Let it end or let me die so I wont have to watch any more of it
The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy
It wasnt the journey itself uncle but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull
I want more uncles here to welcome me
Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous
Your Grace heard their saccharine words but didnt take note of their poisonous intentions
God protect you from them and from other false friends
God should keep me from false friends but they werent false
My lord the mayor of London is here to greet you
God bless your Grace with health and happy days
And what a slug Hastings is that he hasnt even arrived to tell us whether theyre coming
And just in time here comes the sweaty lord
Welcome my lord
What isnt my mother coming
God knows why but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey
Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you but his mother wouldnt let him
I wouldnt commit so serious a crime for anything
In these less dainty times youre not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him
The prince has done neither therefore in my opinion he isnt really protected by sanctuary
Often I have heard of sanctuary men but until now Ive never heard of sanctuary children My lord youve won me over this time
Lord Hastings will you go with me
Im coming my lord
Go as fast as you can
Say uncle Richard if my brother comes where will I stay till my coronation
Whatever seems best to you
Of all places I dont like the 
He started it my noble lord and succeeding generations rebuilt it
Is it on record that he built it or is it just word of mouth
On record my gracious lord
Well I think that even if it werent on record the truth would be remembered from one generation to the nextall the way to Doomsday
What did you say uncle
Death didnt conquer 
The king wont live I hope
Ill marry the earl of Warwicks youngest daughter Lady Anne
So what if I killed her husband and her father
So thats what Ill do not because I love her but because Ill get something out of it
But Im running ahead of myself
Clarence is still alive Edward is not only alive hes king
Only when theyre dead can I start to count my gains
What my dear lord
Richard of York how are you doing my loving brother
Very well my supreme lordthats what I have to call you now
Hows my nephew doing noble lord of York
Thank you for asking uncle
Oh my lord you once said that lazy weeds grow fast
The prince has far outgrown me
He has my lord
Does that mean hes lazy
Oh my handsome nephew I must not say that
In that case hes more obliged to you than I am
He may command me as my king but you still have power over me as a relative
Uncle please give me your dagger
My dagger little nephew
With all my heart
Are you begging brother
From my kind uncle who I know will give it to me especially as its not worth much
Ill give you a greater gift than that nephew
A greater gift
That must mean a sword
Yes gentle cousin if it were light enough for you
Oh I see you will only part with lightweight presents
For more important things youll say no
A swords too heavy for you to wear
I wouldnt think much of it even if it were heavier
Whats that
But uncle you know how to bear with him
You mean to bear me not to bear        My protector Richard insists on it
I cant sleep quietly in the Tower
Why what are you afraid of
My uncle Clarences angry ghost
My grandmother told me he was murdered there
Im not afraid of dead uncles
Nor living ones I hope
Well I hope not
No doubt no doubt
Oh hes a dangerously clever boybold quickwitted capable
Hes his mothers child from head to toe
Well enough about themCome here Catesby
Hastings loved the princes father so much that we wont be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince
What about Stanley
Wont he join us
Hell do whatever Hastings does
Okay just do this noble Catesby sound out Lord Hastings but make it seem as if youre just mulling over the idea that it hasnt been firmed up yet
If he seems game to our plan encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons
But if hes resistant and chilly then be like that too and break off the conversation
Give my regards to Hastings Catesby
My good lords I plan to
Will we hear from you before bedtime Catesby
You will my lord
Youll find us both at Crosby Place
Now my lord what are we going to do if we find that Lord Hastings wont go along with our plans
Chop off his head
Whatever we decide to do
And when Im king remember to ask me for the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it which my brother the king used to own
I look forward to that present
Youll find Ill give it to you very willingly
Come lets have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans
A messenger from Lord Stanley
Four oclock in the morning
Cant Lord Stanley sleep
I guess notfor good reason as youll soon hear
First he sends his regards
And then
Besides that he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him who are at the other sorry
While he and I are at one my loyal servant Catesby will be at the other so nothing will happen that we wont find out about
Tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries
And as for his dreams Im surprised hes so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night
If we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us well only make the boar angry and suspicious causing him to chase us when he never intended to
Good morning my noble lord
Good day Catesby
Youre up early
What news can you tell me in this fastmoving unsteady state of ours
I believe it wont stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm
What do you mean wears the wreath
Are you talking about the crown
Yes my good lord
Ill have my head cut from my shoulders before Ill see the crown so misplaced
But do you think thats what hes aiming for
For that reason he sends you this good newsthat this very day your enemies the queens relatives will die at Pomfret
Well Im not sorry to hear that because they have always been my enemies
Well lets hope you stay in that noble frame of mind
But as for nowbefore two weeks have gone by Im going to send some people packing
Its a horrible thing to die when youre not prepared for it my gracious lord
Yes monstrous monstrous
Thats how it will be for some other men too who think theyre as safe as you and I who are wellloved by noble Richard and Buckingham
I know they do and I certainly deserve it
Youre afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear
My lord good morning
Good morning Catesby
My lord my life is as important to me as yours is to you and it was never as precious to me as it is now
Do you think I would be feeling as triumphant as I am if I didnt know that our situation was secure
I hope to God Im proven wrong
Well should we head to the Tower
The day is well on its way
Set down your honorable load men if there is ever any honor in being dead
You know what my lord
Those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today
They deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions
But come my lord lets go
Go on ahead
Ill talk with this good man
Whats up man
Hows it going
Better since your lordship was nice enough to ask
I tell you man its better for me too than the last time we met here
But now I tell youkeep it to yourself thoughthose enemies of mine are being put to death today and Im better than Ive ever been
Well lets hope your good fortune continues
Here drink to me
God be good to you
A nice coincidence my lord
Im glad to see you
I thank you Sir John with all my heart
I am indebted to you for your last sermon
By next week Ill be able to pay you
Your friends at Pomfret theyre the ones who need a priest
When I ran into this holy man those men you mentioned did come to mind in fact
Are you headed to the Tower
Ill be off before you are
Yes probably because Im staying for lunch
Ill follow you my lord
Hurry up
Your lives are over
Oh Pomfret Pomfret
Oh you bloody prison fatal and threatening to noble lords
Now Margarets curse has fallen on our heads for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son
She cursed Hastings then
Oh God remember to hear her prayer for them just as for us
But dont kill my sister and her royal sons be satisfied dear God with our blood which is being spilled unjustly as you know
Hurry up
The hour of death is approaching
Come Grey
Come Vaughan
Lets embrace 
In Gods name speak
When should the royal day be
Is everything ready for that event
It is
Tomorrows a good day
Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks
Whos closest to him
You I think would best know what hes thinking
We know each others faces but as for our thoughts he doesnt know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or hisor you do about mine
Lord Hastings you and he are close
Thank you
I know he holds me dear but I havent asked him about the coronation and he hasnt told me
But you my noble lords may name a time and Ill second it on the dukes behalf which I dont think hell mind
Right on cue heres the duke himself
My noble lords and relatives good morning
If you hadnt shown up on cue my lord Lord Hastings was going to take your partI mean he was going to speak for youin the crowning of the king
No one may be bolder than my Lord Hastings
Buckingham I need to have a word with you
Ill come soon
We have not yet set the coronation day
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester
I have sent for the strawberries
Richard is looking cheerful today
You always know hes got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto
I dont think theres a man under the sun whos worse at hiding his love or hate than Richard
I pray to God he isnt
Then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes
If they have done this thing my noble lord If
You lover of that damned whore youre talking to me of ifs
Youre a traitorOff with his head
I pity England but not myself
Stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him and I laughed and refused to flee with him
Three times today my horse stumbled and started when he looked in the direction of the Tower as if he hated to carry me to this slaughterhouse
Oh now I really need that priest who spoke to me today
And I regret having bragged to the messenger about how my enemies were being butchered at Pomfret while I as I said was in good standing with Richard
Oh Margaret Margaret your heavy curse has now landed on poor Hastingss miserable head
Make your confession short
Hes eager to see your head
We spend more time seeking out the fleeting glories of this temporary world than looking to the permanent grace of God
Anyone who builds his hopes on air lives like a drunken sailor hanging on a mast ready with every dizzy nod of his head to tumble to the bottom of the sea
Come come hurry up
Its pointless to talk now
Oh bloody Richard
Miserable England I foresee for you the most frightening time you have ever experiencedCome lead me to the block
Bring him my head
Those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves
Frightening looks are also at my service as are fake smiles
But has Catesby gone
A drum
And if he ever has a wife let her be more miserable when he dies than I am now
What wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite
Lord Mayor the reason we have sent Look behind you
Defend yourself
There are enemies here
God defend and guard us innocents against them
Stay calm
Theyre friendsRatcliffe and Lovell
Heres the head of that notorious traitor the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings
I loved this man so much it makes me weep
He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadnt been for his love affair with Shores wife I would never have suspected him
He would have
What do you think were Turks or savages instead of Christians
I didnt expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore
But my good lord the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself
That is exactly why we wanted you here your lordshipto avoid the public carping and complaints
There was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on
And if you need to approach the subject of me tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward my noble father was fighting in France
But only hint at this vaguely because as you know my mothers still alive
Goodbye my lord
If things go well bring the crowd to  Im off
Around three or four oclock look for news from the meeting hall
Lovell go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw
Now Ill go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarences brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edwards sons
Heres the indictment of the good Lord Hastings which has been written out in a clear hand like any legal document so it can be read aloud in public outside St Pauls Cathedral
What a backward world we live in
Why whos so stupid that he cant see through this fraud
The world is a bad place where you cant speak what you know
Its incrediblethey didnt say a word
Did you mention that Edwards children are bastards
I did
He said that the people werent used to being spoken to except by the  What blocks of wood
They wouldnt say anything
Arent the mayor and his fellow citizens coming
The mayor is here at hand
And make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests okay
But dont be easily won over
Im going now
If youre as good at pleading to them as I am at saying no to you this will definitely come to a happy end
Hurry go up to the roof
The Lord Mayor is knocking
Welcome my lord
I dont think he wants to be disturbed
Now Catesby what does your lord say to my request
My lord he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day
Return to the gracious duke good Catesby
Tell him that the mayor some citizens and I have come to confer with his grace in matters of great importance concerning the general good
Ill tell him right away my lord
Ah my lord this prince is nothing like Edward
Hes not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body but praying to nourish his attentive soul
England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king
But Im afraid well never get him to agree to be king
But God forbid he says no to us
Im afraid he will
Here comes Catesby again
Whats up Catesby what does your master say
My lord he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him since he had no idea they were coming
My lord hes afraid you mean him harm
Im sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me
When devoutly religious men are praying its hard to draw them out of it because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation
See how he stands between two clergymen
My lord you dont need to apologize
I beg you to pardon me
I suspect that I have committed some offence to the city and you have come to reprimand me for not knowing better
You have my lord
Sweet saint for goodnesss sake dont be so angry
If you enjoy looking at your awful deeds take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries
Its your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins
Oh earth which soaks up this blood revenge his death
Either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him as it does this good kings blood
If I dont answer perhaps youll think Im accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me
First of all even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crownif it were truly my birthrightI would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it
So thank God there is no real need for me as I wouldnt be able to help you much
The royal tree has left us other fruit which with time will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king Im sure
God forbid that I snatch the crown from him
King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucyyour mother can vouch for thatand then he was betrothed to Bona the King of Frances sisterinlaw
But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressedout widow long past her prime
Dont refuse the love we offer you
Oh make them joyful
Grant their lawabiding request
Alas why would you heap all these responsibilities on me
I am unfit to rule and to be king
Please dont take it badly but I cannot and will not give in to you
But listen if 
Oh please dont swear my lord of Buckingham
If you refuse it the whole country will regret it
Would you tie me to a whole world of worries
Well call them back again
I am not made of stone I am affected by all these kind pleas though it goes against my conscience and my soul
God bless your Grace
We understand youre just doing it for us and well be sure to say so
If you say that youll only be telling the truth
Then I salute you with this royal title long live Richard Englands worthy king
Amen
Will you be crowned tomorrow
Whenever you want since youre the one who wants it
Whos this
My granddaughter with her kind aunt the duchess of Gloucester leading her by the hand
Now on my life the young child must be headed to the Tower to greet the young princes whom she adores
Where are you going
Just to the TowerIm guessing for the same reason you are to salute the noble princes who are staying there
Yes kind sister
We can all go together
And here comes the warden just in time
Theyre just fine my dear madam
But Im sorryIm not allowed to let you visit them
The king has strictly forbidden it
The king
Whos that
I meant to say the Lord Protector
The Lord keep him from the title of king
Richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs
I am their mother
Whos going to keep me from them
I am their fathers mother
I will see them
I am their aunt and I love them like a mother
So take me to see them
Officer Ill take the responsibility from you and the blame too
No madam no
I cant do this
I am bound by oath so please forgive me
In just an hour from now Duchess of York Ill be saluting you as the mother of two beautiful queens
Oh cut my bodicestaps so that my pentup heart can have some room to breathe or Ill faint from this deadly news
Cruel cruel news  
Your mothers name has become a threat to her own children
Ill write to my stepson Richmond on your behalf so that hell meet you on the way
But dont delay
O this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery
It has hatched a    I go unwillingly
I wish to God that the golden crown that Ill have to wear were redhot steel and burned me straight through to the brain
If you want to make me happy dont wish yourself harm
No
Why
Every night Im awakened by his  Poor dear goodbye
I pity your situation
No more than I do yours
Goodbye
You are a rude ragged nurse and an old sullen playmate for such tender princes
Please treat my babies well
Dear woman you dont know the rules of charity
Villain you dont know the laws of God or of man
Even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity
If I know nothing about pity that must mean Im not an animal
Its even stranger when an angel is so angry
Divine perfect woman give me a chance to prove in detail that Im innocent of the evils you accuse me of
Contagious infection of humanity give me a chance to condemn you for the evils I know youve committed
You who are beautiful beyond words calm down and let me explain myself
You who are wicked beyond belief the only explanation Ill accept from you is for you to hang yourself
Such an expression of despair would only prove that I was guilty
My gracious king
Give me your hand
Because of your advice and your help I have a high position now
But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time
Let them last forever
Oh Buckingham now Im going to test to see if youre truly made of gold
Young Prince Edward is still alivewhat do you think Im going to say next
Go on my loving lord
Ha
But Edward is still alive
True noble prince
Oh how bitter it is that Edwardthe real true noble princeshould still be alive
Cousin you didnt used to be so thickheaded
Shall I put it plainly
What do you say
Your Grace can do whatever he wants
Tut tut youve become rather icy
Tell me do I have your consent to kill them
Give me a little breathing space my lord a little pause to think
Ill let you know my answer shortly
My lord
Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money
Whats his name
His name is Tyrrel my lord
I know the man a bit
Go bring him here boy
Look whos here
Whats the news with you
You should know my loving lord Ive heard that the marquess Dorset has fled to Brittany to the earl of Richmond
Come here Catesby
Spread the rumor abroad that Anne my wife is very sick
And find a poverty stricken gentleman who I can marry straightaway to Clarences daughter
Look at you standing there in a stupor
I repeat spread the rumor that Anne my wife is sick and likely to die
Are you Tyrrel
James Tyrreland your most obedient subject
Are you indeed
Do you dare kill a friend of mine
Well thats what you get to do
Two great enemies in fact enemies to my peace of mind
Tyrrel I mean those bastards in the Tower
Give me access to them and soon you wont have to worry about them anymore
Thats music to my ears
Come here Tyrrel
By this token youll be admitted to their cell
Get up and listen to me
Thats all there is to it
As soon as the deed is done you will be in my favor and I will promote you
Ill do it right away
My lord I have thought over the request you just made of me
Well it doesnt matter anymore
Dorset has fled to the earl of Richmond
I heard the news my lord
Stanley Richmond is your wifes son
Get information from her
My lord Id want to have the gift you promised me on your honor the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it
Stanley pay attention to your wifes doings
If she sends any letters to Richmond you will be accountable to me for it
What do you say your Highness about my just request
As I remember Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy
A king perhaps My lord How is it that the prophet didnt tell me at the time that I would kill him
My lord your promise of the earldom Richmond
The last time I was in Exeter the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it  My lord
Yes what time is it
Im reminding your grace what you promised me
Well but what time is it
Its almost ten oclock
Well let it strike ten then
Why let it strike
Because youre like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bellyou keep interrupting my thoughts
I am not in the giving mood today
Youre bothering me
Im not in the mood
Is this really happening
Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt
Did I work to make him king for this
Oh let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to 
It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of
Dighton and Forrest whom I hired to perform the butchery are used to killing people the bloody dogs
Their lips like four red roses on a stalk touched
Kind Tyrrel will your news make me happy
If my doing what you told me to makes you happy then be happy because I did it
But did you see them dead
I did my lord
And buried noble Tyrrel
The Towers chaplain has buried them but to tell you the truth I dont know where
Tyrrel come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths
In the meantime think about how I can do you good and give you what you want
See you soon
I humbly say goodbye
Edwards sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne my wife has bid good night to the world
Now I go a jolly thriving wooer to marry my brother Edwards young daughter Elizabeth because I know Richmond has his eye on her
My lord
Is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking
Bad news my lord
The Bishop of Ely has fled to Richmond and Buckingham backed by a hardy Welsh army is on the march
Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army
Lets say I didnt kill them
Then you might as well say theyre not dead
But they are dead and you killed them you slave of the devil
I did not kill your husband
Well then he must be alive
Youre lying
Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood
She provoked me with her lying mouth accusing me of crimes I didnt commit
No what provoked you was your own bloody mind which never thinks about anything but butchering
You killed this king didnt you
Yes Ill grant you that
Youll grant me you hedgehog
Then let God grant me that youll be damned for that wicked deed
Oh he was gentle mild and virtuous
That will please God who has him now
He is in heaven where you will never go
Let him thank me who helped him get there
Ive lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies
Ill head to France soon
Its time to hide wretched Margaret
Whos coming
Ah my poor princes
If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mothers lament
Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved with her children dead before their time
Ive been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute
Edward Plantagenet why are you dead  
Will you abandon such gentle lambs God and throw them to the wolves
Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done
Let my sorrow have the upper hand
You had a Clarence too and Richard killed him
Oh righteous God how can I thank you enough that this meateating mutt preys on his mothers children and forces her to join others in their grief
O Harrys wife do not triumph in my sorrow
With God as my witness I swear I have wept for yours
Your son Edward who stabbed my son Edward is dead
Your Clarence who stabbed my Edward is also dead
Richard a fiendish spy for hell itself still lives but only long enough to buy souls to send below
I pray that God ends his life before I die so I can say The dog is dead
Oh you prophesied that the time would come when I would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider that hideous toad
Back then I called you a poor imitation queen a badly reproduced copy of what I was a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell a mother only teased with two beautiful children who would soon die
And I was right because wheres your husband now
Your brothers
Your two sons
Now you have only the memory of what you were which tortures you when you consider what youve become
You once stole my position now you get to have the grief that goes with it
Your English sorrows will make me smile in France
You who are so skilled in cursing stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies
Remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is
Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse
Think like this all day and youll learn how to curse
My words are dull
Enliven them with yours
Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine
But give words a chance
If thats true then dont be tonguetied
Come with me and lets smother my fiendish sonwho smothered your two sweet sonsin bitter words
Whos blocking the way
The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders youve committed by strangling you in her cursed womb
Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown when if there was any justice in this world it should be branded with the murders you committedyour slaughter of the prince who held that crown and of my sons and my brothers
Tell me you villainous lowlife where are my children
Where are the noble Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey
Where is kind Hastings
Play trumpets
Dont let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lords anointed king
Play I say
Either be calm and polite or Ill drown you out with the music of war
Are you my son
Yes I thank God my father and yourself
Then patiently listen to my impatience
Madam Im a bit like you in that I cant tolerate a tone of disapproval
Oh let me speak
Go ahead but I wont listen
Ill be gentle and mild
And brief good motherIm in a hurry
Are you that impatient
God knows I waited for you in anguish pain and agony when I gave birth to you
And didnt I finally arrive to comfort you
So what hour of comfort have I ever had in your company
Name one
Youre too bitter
Just listen this once
Ill never speak to you again
So be it
Though I have far more reason I dont have as much energy to curse you
But I say amen to everything she said
Wait madam
I need to speak a word with you
I have no more royal sons for you to murder
You have a daughter named Elizabeth who is virtuous and beautiful aristocratic and full of grace
And does she have to die for this
Oh let her live and Ill ruin her manners and her beauty
So that she may live Ill say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child
Dont wrong her birth
She has royal blood
To save her life Ill say she doesnt
Yes as safe as her brothers lives were
Bad friends were
My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life
Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts youre the one who gave the order
No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heartyou reveled in my lambs bloody guts
But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame so Im not going to say any more about my boys until Ive gouged your eyes out with my bare hands
Madam if I do as well as I think Im going to do in these dangerous violent wars you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than youve ever had bad
What good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now
The advancement of your children noble lady
Advancement to some scaffold to lose their heads
No advancement to the dignity and height of honor to a high imperial kind of glory
And youre not suited for any place except hell
Yes and one other place if youll only let me name it
Some dungeon
Your bedroom
There is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are
Exactly madam until I sleep with you
Well explainbut do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isnt used up by talking about it
Then know that from my soul I love your daughter
I believe it
What do you believe
That you love my daughter to spite your soul
Dont be so quick to twist my meaning
The one who makes her queen of course
Who else should it be
What you
What do you think madam
How would you woo her
And  Madam with all my heart
Come come youre making fun of me
This is not the way to win your daughter
There isnt any other way unless you took on another form and became someone else
But suppose I did all the things you named out of love for her
Then she has no choice but to hate you as you purchased her love with murder
Whatever has already been done cant be undone now
Men act imprudently sometimes then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them
If I took the kingdom from your sons Ill give it to your daughter to make up for it
If I have killed your children I will have children with your daughter
A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is
Your children caused you trouble in your youth but mine will bring you comfort in your old age
I cant make up for everything that Id like to so accept such kindness as I can offer
Indeed we have many good days to look forward to
Go then mother to your daughter
What should I say to her
That her fathers brother wants to be her husband
Or should I say its her uncle
Or should I describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles
How can I describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with God the law my honor and her feelings
Claim fair Englands peace depends on this alliance
She will purchase that peace with an everlasting war
Tell her that the king who has the power to command people asks her
He asks her to do what God  Say she will be a high and mighty queen
Only to watch that title become worthless as her mother has
Say I will love her everlastingly
But how long will ever last
Until her beautiful lifes end
But how long will her beautiful life last
As long as heaven and nature extend it
As long as hell and Richard want it
Tell her that I her king am her lowly subject
But she your subject hates such a king
Be eloquent on my behalf
An honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply
Then tell her my loving story in simple terms
You cant tell a story simply when its a lie
Your answers are too shallow and too hasty
Oh no my reasons are deep and as permanent as death
Dont harp on that point madamits past
I will harp on it till my heartstrings break
Now by St George my knighthood and my crown The first you profaned the second you dishonored and the third you stole
I swear By nothing because this is no oath
St George loses his holiness once  Then by myself Youve misused yourself
Now by the world Its full of your ugly wrongdoings
By my fathers death Your life has dishonored his death
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child and both princes would still be alive not preyed on by worms
What can you swear by now
By the future
There are parents living whose children you have butchered they are now old withered plants who will moan over their losses as they grow old
Dont swear by the future because youve ruined it before it has even arrived
May I only do well in these dangerous battles if my intention to repent and prosper is sincere
Let me destroy myself let heaven and destiny deprive me of happy hours let day remain dark and night sleepless and let me have nothing but terrible luck if I do not love with a pure heart clean devotion and holy thoughts your beautiful royal daughter
My happiness and yours lie in her
It 
Shall I be tempted by the devil
Yes if the devil tempts you to do good
Yes if your memories do you no good
Yet you killed my children
But in your daughters womb I will bury them
Should I go convince my daughter to marry you
And be a happy mother by doing so
Im going
Write to me very soon and Ill let you know what she thinks
Many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and arent willing to beat it back
Word is that Richmond is the navys admiral
Someone who can ride fast go to the duke of  Here my good lord
Catesby fly to the duke
I will my lord as fast as I can
Ratcliffe come here
Ride to Salisbury
Oh right good Catesby
Tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at Salisbury
Im off
What would you like me to do at Salisbury
Why what is there to do before I get there
Your Highness just told me that I should ride there before you
I changed my mind
Stanley what news do you have
Nothing that you want to hear my lord but nothing so bad that I cant mention it
Well how nice a riddle
Neither good nor bad
Why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point
Once again whats the news
Richmond is sailing on the sea
Let him sink there so the sea will cover him
Lilylivered coward whats he doing there
Well what do you guess
That stirred up by Dorset Buckingham and Morton hes coming to England to claim the crown
They are my daylight my life
Then I hope night shadows your day and death takes your life
Dont damn yourself
I wish I were so I could deprive you of both day and life
There is no better one on earth
Is the throne empty
Is the army without a leader
Is the king dead the empire dispossessed
What heir of the York family is there alive other than myself
And who is Englands king but an heir of the great York
Therefore tell me what is he doing at sea
Where is your army then to beat him back
Where are your tenants and your followers
Arent they at this very moment on the western shore helping the rebels land safely from their ships
Then theyre cold friends to me
What are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king
They havent been commanded to go to the west mighty king
If your Majesty would like Ill muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like
Most mighty sovereign you have no reason to doubt my friendship
I was never disloyal and I never will be
Then go gather your men but leave behind your son George Stanley
My noble king my friends have informed me that Sir Edward Courtney and his brother the haughty Bishop of Exeter are now in  My king the Guildfords in  My lord the duke of Buckinghams army Enough you 
The news I have to tell your majesty is that Buckinghams army has dispersed from sudden floods and heavy rainfall
Buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where
I beg your pardon
Yes your Highness
Even if we dont fight foreign enemies well beat down these rebels at home
While were talking here a royal battle could be won and lost
Someone deliver the order that Buckingham be brought to Salisbury
Everyone else march on with me
But tell me where is the noble Richmond now
At Pembroke or at Harfordwest in Wales
Sir Walter Herbert a renowned soldier Sir Gilbert Talbot Sir William Stanley Oxford the highly feared Pembroke Sir James Blunt Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew and many other famous and powerful noblemen
Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads
Im left with nothing to do in this weak idle peacetime unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about 
Wont King Richard let me speak with him
No my good lord
So be calm
Hastings and Edwards children Rivers and Grey holy King Henry and your fine son Edward Vaughan and all who have died from underhanded corrupt fiendish injustice if your angry souls are witnessing this moment through the clouds enjoy the revengelaugh at my ruin
This is  It is my lord
Why then its my bodys doomsday
Today Im going to get what I said I wished would happen to me if I was ever false to King Edwards children or his wifes allies
This is the day Im going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me
This this AllSouls day is my just desserts
I tried to play games with God and he turned my fake prayer on my head giving me for real what Id asked for as a joke
This is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves
I have done wrong so I will suffer wrong
I suspect his friends will join us
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him
In his greatest need even they will desert him
All to our advantage
So in Gods name lets march
Hope with good cause is swift it flies as fast as a swallow
It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks
My Lord of Norfolk Here most gracious king
Norfolk were going to have a few blows right
Weve got to give them and take them my lord
Ill lie here tonight
But where will I lie tomorrow
Well it doesnt matter
Six or seven thousand at most
Why our troops amount to three times that
Besides the kings name is a tower of strength the opposition doesnt have that advantage
Lets be disciplined and not delay because tomorrow is a busy day
My Lord of Oxford you Sir William Brandon and you Sir Walter Herbert are going to stay with me
Good Captain Blunt tell the earl goodnight from me and tell him that by two in the morning I would like him to visit my tent
Unless Ive mistaken his battle flags which Im sure I havent his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the kings mighty army
If its possible to do this without putting yourself in danger dear Captain Blunt say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note
Upon my life my lord Ill do it
There is a man who loves you better than your husband could
Name him
Plantagenet
Yes thats my husbands name
Someone else has the same name but hes a better man
Where is this man
Here
Why do you spit at me
If only I could spit poison
Poison never came from such a sweet place
Poison never landed on such an ugly toad
Get out of my sight
Youre poisoning my eyes
Your beautiful eyes sweet lady have infected mine with love
I wish my eyes were 
Good night dear Captain Blunt
Come gentlemen lets discuss tomorrows action in my tent
The night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors
What time is it
Its dinnertime my lord
Its nine oclock
Im not going to eat dinner tonight
Give me some ink and paper
Is the visor of my helmet working better now
And has my armor been put in my tent
My good man Norfolk hurry to your post
Im off my lord
Get up early tomorrowat the sound of the larknoble Norfolk
I will my lord
Catesby
Yes my lord
Yes my lord
Did you see the gloomy Lord Northumberland
Thomas the earl of Surrey and he were moving from troop to troop around twilight cheering up the soldiers
Good Im satisfied
Set it down
Is my ink and paper ready
It is my lord
Ratcliffe around midnight come to my tent and help me put on my armor
Now leave me alone as I said
Let fortune and victory be yours
I wish you all the comfort that such a dark night as this can offer noble fatherinlaw
Tell me how is my mother
Your mother sends her blessings
To be briefas the occasion requiresprepare to fight early in the morning when your future will be decided
I cant do everything I want to but Ill help you as well as I can
But I cant be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother young George
Farewell
The lack of time and the risk Im under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each others news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long
I hope we have the time some day
Again goodbye
Be brave and do well
Again good night kind lords and gentlemen
Oh God whose side I think Im fighting on look kindly on my forces
Make us your agents of revenge so we can praise you when were victorious
Before I fall asleep I entrust my soul to you
Defend me God both when Im asleep and when Im awake      
Im sweating and trembling with fear
Myself
Yes I am
Then run away
What from myself
Why
Did I do anything good to myself
Oh no
I am a villain
Fool do not flatter yourself
Give me another horse
Bandage my wounds
Have mercy JesusWait I was only dreaming
Oh cowardly conscience how youre torturing me
But what am I afraid of
Myself
Theres no one else here
Richard loves Richard that is theres just me and myself here
Is there a murderer here
No
Yes I am
Then run away
What from myself
Unfortunately I love myself
Why
Did I do anything good to myself
Oh no
Alas I hate myself instead because of the hateful deeds Ive committed
I am a villain
Fool speak well of yourself
Fool do not flatter yourself
My lord
Damn it whos there
Ratcliffe my lord its me
The rooster has already crowed twice
Your friends are up and buckling on their armor
Oh Ratcliffe I had a terrifying dream
What do you think will my friends prove loyal
No doubt my lord
By St Paul ghosts have struck more terror in my soul tonight than ten thousand of worthless Richmonds soldiers could dressed up in their most swordproof armor
Its not yet daylight
Come with me Ill spy under the tents to see if any of my own people plan to desert me
Good morning Richmond
Pardon me lords and gentlemen who stayed awake
How did you sleep my lord
Since you left Ive been enjoying the sweetest sleep and most promising dreams Ive ever had my lords
I dreamed the souls of the people Richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory
I tell you I feel very jolly remembering such a beautiful dream
How late is it lords
Its almost four
Why then its time to put on my armor and instruct the troops 
We have God and a good cause on our side
The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like highwalled fortresses
Other than Richard even those whom we fight against would rather we won
Because who is this man they follow
If you struggle to bring down a tyrant you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed
When you fight against your countrys enemies you will be paid for your efforts with your countrys wealth
If you fight to protect your wives your wives will welcome you home as conquerors
When you free your children from the sword your grandchildren will repay you in your old age
So in the name of God and all the good that will come of this 
I wish they were so that I could die right now because at this point I live a living death
I never tried to win over a friend or enemy with sweet words
If your vengeful heart cant forgive me heretake my sword and bury it in my heart so that my soul which adores you can be free
No dont pause because I 
What did Northumberland say about Richmond
That he was never trained as a soldier
Thats true
And what did Surrey say to that
He smiled and said The better for us Hes right and thats how it is
Read the time there
Give me an almanac
I didnt my lord
Ratcliffe
My lord
The sun will not appear today
The sky frowns and scowls on our army
I wish there wasnt so much dew on the ground
So the sun wont shine today
Get ready my lord
The enemy is making its appearance on the battlefield
Hurry hurryprepare my horse
John Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Earl of Surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers
Ill follow in the center of the troop formation which Ill defend with my best horse and with Saint George on my side as well
What do you think Norfolk
A good plan warrior king
I found this pinned to my tent this morning  
Listen
I hear their drums
Startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking
What does Lord Stanley say
Will he bring his army
My lord he refuses to come
Off with his son Georges head
My lord the enemy has already passed the marsh
Let George Stanley die after the battle
Lets go
Victory is with us
Help my lord of Norfolk help help
The king performs more wonders than seem humanly possible challenging every enemy he sees
His horse is killed so hes fighting on foot risking his life to search out Richmond
Help dear lord or the battle will be lost
A horse a horse Id give my kingdom for a horse
Get off the field my lord
Ill find you another horse
God and your work be praised victorious friends
Great God of heaven say amen to all this
But tell me is young George Stanley alive
He is my lord and safe in Leicester where if youd like we can retreat to
John Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon
As I vowed I will unite the York and Lancaster families
Smile then on this beautiful union
What traitor hears me and doesnt say amen
Now let Richmond and Elizabeth the true heirs of each royal house be joined together
Gracious Lord blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor England apart again
Let those who would mar this fair lands peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth
Civil wounds now can heal and peace can live again
So that England may live a long life like this let God say amen
Take up the sword again or take me up
Get up liar
Though I wish you were dead Im not going to be the one to kill you
I have already
You said it when you were furious
Say it againjust one word and my hand which killed your lover out of love will kill your far truer lover
You will be an accessory to both crimes
I wish I knew what was in your heart
Ive told you
I fear that your words and your heart are both false
Then no man has ever been honest
Well then put your sword away
Tell me that youll accept my love
Youll know about that later
But can I have some hope
Id like to think all men have some hope
Please wear this ring
Wear both the ring and my heart because both are yours
And if I your poor devoted servant may ask you for one small favor you will guarantee my happiness forever
Whats that
Please leave it to me to take care of the burial as I have more reason to mourn than you do
For various reasons that must remain secret please do this for me
Ill do it with all my heart
Say goodbye to me
Sirs take up the corpse
Toward Chertsey noble lord
No to the Whitefriars monastery
Wait for me there
Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind
And has anyone ever won her as Ive done
Ill get her but I wont keep her long
And yet against all odds I win her over
Ha
Has she already forgotten her brave husband Prince Edward whom I stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger
He was graced with lots of natural gifts he was young valiant wise and no doubt meant to be king
And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me who cut her sweet princes life short and made her a widow
On me though I am barely half the man that Edward was
On me though I am limping and deformed
I bet Ive been wrong about myself all this time
Even though I dont see it this lady thinks Im a marvelously goodlooking man
Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions
Since Im suddenly all the rage it will be worth the cost
But first Ill dump this fellow in his grave then return to my love weeping with grief
Come out beautiful sununtil Ive bought a mirror to admire my reflection in Ill watch my shadow as I stroll along
Be patient madam
Im sure his majesty will recover his health soon
Then youll be able to cheer  If he were dead what would happen to me
But hes young and as long as hes too young to become king Richard the duke of Gloucester has power over him
Richard loves neither me nor any of you
Has it been decided that Richard will be  Its been decided though not yet officially announced
I hope God makes you happy again like you once were
Did you see the king today Lord Derby
Yes the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him
What are the chances of his getting better lords
Madam keep up hope
He seems cheerful
God give him health
Did you talk with him
Yes madam
I wish I could believe you that all was well
Theyre out to get me and I wont stand for it
Which of you has been complaining to the king that I dont like them
Cant a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick sneaky lowlifes
Which of us are you referring to
You who are neither honest nor good
When did I ever do you any harm
Or any of you
Damn you all
The kingwhom I hope God will protect better than you would likecant get a minutes rest without you bothering him with your outrageous complaints
Brother youve made a mistake
He  I cant tell whats going on
The world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost
Come come I know what youre referring to Richard
You resent my friends rise in society and my own
Lets hope we never need your help for anything
Meanwhile were the ones who need you
My brother is imprisoned because of you I am disgraced and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago werent worth a dime have suddenly been promoted
By the Lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life I used to enjoy I promise you I never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of Clarence
Since I cant amuse myself by being a lover Ive decided to become a villain
Ive set dangerous plans in motion using lies drunken prophecies and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other
His majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the  Youre being arrested
Why
Because my name is George
Thats not your fault
He should imprison the person who named you instead
Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed
But really whats going on Clarence
Can you tell me
She could even what
Certainly your grandmother had a worse match
My lord of Gloucester I have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long
By God I will tell the king about these taunts
I would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant I could escape your scorn and constant harassment
Ive had very little joy as Englands queen  
If you were king we would do the same
If I were king
Id rather be a peddler
Hear me you wrangling pirates
Which of you does not tremble when you see me
Ugly wrinkled witch what are you doing here
Only describing what you have ruined
Or at least thats what I plan to do before I let you go
Werent you banished on pain of death
I was
The sorrow that I feel actually belongs to you and the high life you enjoy actually belongs to me
Oh killing that child was the dirtiest most merciless deed there ever was
Tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it
Even  What were you all snarling before I arrived ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs but now that Im here you turn your hatred toward me
All because of what happened to that brat Rutland
Enough of your magic spells you hateful withered hag
And leave you out
Dont move dog
Its your turn now
Richard
Yes
I didnt call you
I beg your pardonI thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names
Yes I was but I dont want an answer from you
Let me finish my curse
Ive finished it for you and it ends in Margaret Hes turned your curse against you Margaret
Poor imitation queen why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when hes got you trapped in his deadly web
The day will come when youll wish I could help you cast spells against this poisonous hunchbacked toad
Woman stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you
Shame on you Ive already run out of patience with you all
If you got what you deserved you would learn some respect
What I deserve is that you treat me like a queen and what you deserve is to act like my subjects
Give me what I deserve and do your duty
People in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind and when they fall they shatter into pieces
Good advice indeed
Take it to heart Dorset
It applies to you as much as to me my lord
But you turn that sun into a shadow
You are building your nest in 
Stopif you cant be kind at least have some shame
How dare you talk about kindness or shame
Enough enough
Your clothes arent spattered with my familys blood and you arent affected by my curse
No one here is affected by your curse because curses are just words with no power
What is she saying my lord
Nothing that interests me my good lord
What you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil Im warning you about
Her curses have made my hair stand on end
Mine too
I dont understand why shes not locked up
I cant blame her
I never caused her any harm as far as I know
But you have all the advantages from the harm done
And look how hes repaid poor Clarence for his loyaltypenned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter
God pardon those who are responsible for Clarences troubles
I always pray for them 
Ill tell you as soon as I know Richard because at this point I have no idea
He picked out the letter G from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that G will take the throne away from his children
He thinks G is me
Well this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women
The king isnt the one sending you to the Tower Clarence
Its his wife Lady Grey who got him to do this
Madam his majesty asks for you and for you Duke of Gloucester and for you my noble lords
We will wait on you your majesty
I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels
Dressing my outandout wickedness in scraps of Scripture I look like a saint exactly when Im most like the devil
But quiet
Are you going to take care of this thing now
We are my lord
Good thinking
I have it on me here
Tut tut my lord were not going to stand around chitchatting
Talkers arent good doers
Rest assured that were going there to use our hands not our tongues
When fools cry you remain stony
I like you guys
Hurry now get the job done
We will my noble lord
Why do you look so depressed today your Grace
What was your dream
Tell me
I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him
Looking toward England we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences wed had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters
Lord how painful it was to drown
I saw a thousand shipwrecks a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone huge anchors chunks of gold heaps of pearls and precious jewelsall scattered on the bottom of the sea
So you had time as you were dying to look around
It wouldnt let my soul find its way to air but smothered it inside my gasping body
In fact the real nightmare had only just begun
With the help of the grim  The first to greet me there was my great 
Clarence has arrivedlying cowardly  Im not surprised it scared you my lord
It scares me just to hear you talk about it
I did them for Edwards sakeand look how he rewards meOh God if my prayers dont satisfy you and you have to avenge the wrongs Ive done at least punish me alone
Please spare my innocent wife and childrenKind warden please stay with me for a while
Im feeling very low and I need to sleep
Ill stay my lord
May God bring you sleep
Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons
The only glory princes have are their titles
What do you want fellow
And how did you get in here
I want to speak with Clarence and I came here on my legs
Thats it
Well sir its better to say little than to be tedious
It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you
Here are the keys and there is the duke sleeping
You may sir
Thats a wise idea
Goodbye
What should I stab him while he sleeps
No
When he wakes up
Why he wont wake up till Judgment Day
Okay so thats when hell say we stabbed him in his sleep
That word judgment makes me feel a bit guilty
What are you afraid
Not of killing him because I have a warrant for it but of being damned for killing him which no warrant can protect me from
I thought you were resolved to do this
I am resolvedto let him live
Ill go back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so
Please just wait a minute
Im hoping my holy mood will pass
It usually only lasts about twenty seconds
How are you feeling now
Actually Im still feeling some pangs of conscience
Remember the reward were getting when the deeds done
Jesus lets kill him
I forgot about the reward
Wheres your conscience now
Oh in the duke of Gloucesters wallet
When he opens his wallet to give us our pay your conscience will fly out
It wont matter
Let it fly out
No one will listen to it
And what will you do if it returns to you
I wont bother with it
It blushes is easily embarrassed and stages regular uprisings in a mans heart
Im strongwilled
He wont get the better of me
Spoken like a brave man who respects his reputation
Shall we get to work
Well hit him on the head with the handles of our swords then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room
What an excellent ideahell soak up the wine
Strike
No first lets talk to him
Where are you keeper
Give me a cup of wine
Youll have wine enough my lord soon
In Gods name who are you
A man like you
But not a member of the royal family like me
And youre not loyal like us
Your voice is loud and commanding but you look like a working man
Im speaking for the king but I look like myself
Your eyes look threatening
And why are you so pale
Who sent you here
Why are you here
To to to To murder me
Yes
You barely have the heart to tell me so you cant possibly have the nerve to do it
Besides how have I offended you my friends
You didnt offend us you offended the king
He and I will make up
Never my lord
So prepare to die
Its your job in life to kill the innocent
What did I do wrong
Wheres the evidence against me
Wheres the jury the judge the lawful proceedings the verdict
Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me
For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful
If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christs dear blood which He shed for our terrible sins you must leave and keep your hands off me
What we do we have been commanded to do
All right
If you like Brakenbury you can listen to anything we say
Were not saying anything treasonous man
We say the king is wise and good and his noble queen is getting old pretty and not jealous
And that Mr Shores wife has nice feet cherry lips pretty eyes and a very pleasant way of expressing herself
What do you think
Is there anything inaccurate in that
I have nothing to do with what youre talking about my lord
Her husband you rascal
Are you going to get me in trouble
I beg your 
And the one who commands us is our king
He does and now hes taking revenge on youfor breaking promises and for murder too
Whom you swore you would protect and defend
How dare you tell us about Gods laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself
But for whose sake did I do that sick deed
For my brother Edwards sake
If God will be revenged for this deed he will do it publicly
God doesnt need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him
My brothers love the devil and my own anger made me do it
I am his brother and I love him very much
Youre mistaken
Richard the duke of Gloucester hates you
No he loves and cherishes me
Go to him from me
We will
Tell him that when our noble father the duke of York gave his three sons his blessing he never imagined that our friendship would come to this
Remind Richard of this and he will weep
Yes hell weep stones as he taught us to do
Yes as kind as snow to a harvest
Come on youre fooling yourself
Its Richard who sent us here to slaughter you
Well thats what hes doingmaking you free to enjoy heaven
Make peace with God for you must die my lord
You have enough holy feeling to advise me to make peace with God but youre willing to go to war with God by murdering me
Oh sirs consider this those who sent you to do this deed will hate you for doing it
Relent and save your souls
If either of you were a princes son and you were imprisoned as I am now and two murderers like yourselves came to youwouldnt you beg for your life
Yes you would beg if you were in my position
Relent
No
Thats cowardly and womanish
Look behind you my lord
Take that and that
A  Whats going on
What did you mean by not helping me
By God Im going to tell the duke how slack youve been
I wish you could tell him I saved his brother
Im not
Go coward that you are
Well Ill go hide the body in some hole until the duke gives orders for his burial
And when I get my reward Ill get out of here
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution
I love rich Capulets daughter
Were bound to each other in every possible way except we need you to marry us
Ill tell you more later about when and where we met how we fell in love and how we exchanged promises but now Im begging you please agree to marry us today
Holy Saint Francis this is a drastic change
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline whom you loved so much
Then young men love with their eyes not with their hearts
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears
Theres still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasnt been washed off yet
If you were ever yourself and this sadness was yours you and your sadness were all for Rosaline
And now youve changed
Then repeat this after me you cant expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline
I scolded you for obsessing about her not for loving her my student
And you told me to bury my love
I didnt tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another
Please I beg you dont scold me
The other girl did not love me
Oh she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means
But come on inconsistent young man come with me
Lets get out of here
Im in a rush
Go wisely and slowly
Those who rush stumble and fall
Where the devil can Romeo be
Didnt he come home last night
Not to his fathers house
I asked a servant
That fairskinned hardhearted hussy Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane
Tybalt old Capulets nephew has sent a letter to Romeos fathers house
I bet its a challenge
Romeo will answer the challenge
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter
No Romeo will respond to the letters writer telling him whether he accepts the challenge
Oh poor Romeo
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt
Why whats Tybalts story
He knows what
He looks skinny like a dried herring without its eggs and he hasnt got his girl
O flesh flesh youve turned pale and weak like a fish
Now hes ready for 
Good morning to you both
What do you mean I faked you out
You gave us the slip sir the slip
Cant you understand what Im saying
The  Right
My employer is as good as yours
But hes not better than mine
Well then
You lie
Gregory remember how to slash
What
Come break this up Benvolio
Im losing this duel of wits
Keep going keep going or Ill declare myself the winner
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose
You were never with me for anything if you werent there for the goose
Ill bite you on the ear for that joke
No good goose dont bite me
Your joke is a very bitter apple
Your humor is a spicy sauce
Then isnt it just the right dish for a sweet goose
Oh thats a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard
I stretch my joke for that word fat If you add that word to the word goose it shows that you are a fat goose
Why isnt all this joking better than groaning about love
Now youre sociable
Now youre Romeo
Oh youre wrong
I would have made it short
I had come to the deepest part of my tale and I planned to say nothing more on the topic
Heres something good
Theres twoa man and a woman
Peter
Im at your service
Give me my fan Peter
Good morning gentlemen
Good afternoon fair lady
Is it now afternoon
Its not earlier than that I tell you
The  Get out of here
What kind of man are you
Im a man my lady that God has made for himself to ruin
I swear you speak the truth
For himself to ruin he says
Gentlemen can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo
I can tell you but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him
I am the youngest man by that name because there is no one younger or worse
You speak well
Is the worst well
Very well taken I believe very wise
She will  A pimp
Ive found it out
What have you found out
Romeo are you going to your fathers for lunch
Lets go there
Ill follow after you
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month
If he says anything against me Ill humble him even if he were stronger than he isand twenty punks like him
If I cant do it myself Ill find someone who can
That dirty rat
Im not one of his sluts
Im not one of his punk friends who carries a knife
I didnt see anybody use you for kicks
If I had seen something like that I would have quickly pulled out my weapon
Believe me Ill draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side
Now I swear Im so angry that Im shaking all over
That rotten scoundrel 
Nurse give my regards to to your lady
I swear to you You have a good heart and believe me Ill tell her that
Lord Lord shell be a happy woman
What are you going to tell her Nurse
Youre not paying attention to me
At Friar Lawrences cell she can make confession and be married
Wait good Nurse
Within an hour one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder
Goodbye
Be honest and helpful and Ill repay you for your efforts
Goodbye
Sing my praises to your mistress
May God in heaven bless you
Now please listen sir
What do you have to say my dear Nurse
Can your man keep a secret
Havent you ever heard the saying Two can conspire to put one away
I assure you my man is as true as steel
Well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady
Lord Lord when she was a little babyOh there is one nobleman in the city a guy named Paris who would be happy to claim her as his own
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are
But when I say so I swear she turns white as a sheet
Dont  Yes Nurse what about that
They both begin with the letter R Ah you jokesterthats the dogs name
Give my compliments to your lady
Yes a thousand times
Peter
Im ready  
I sent the Nurse at nine oclock
Maybe she cant find him
That cant be
Oh shes slow
Loves messengers should be thoughts which fly ten times faster than sunbeams
Thats three hours since nine oclock but she hasnt come back
If she was young and passionate shed move as fast as a ball
My words would bounce her to my sweet love and his words would bounce her back to me
But a lot of old people act like theyre already deadsluggish slow fat and colorless like lead
Oh sweet Nurse what news do you bring
Have you spoken to him
Send your man away
Peter wait for me at the gate
Now good sweet NurseOh Lord why do you look so sad
Even if the news is sad tell me with a smile on your face
If the news is good youre ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that
I am tired
Leave me alone for a minute
Oh my my bones ache so much
I wish you had my bones and I had your news
Cant you wait for a moment
Dont you see that Im out of breath
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that youre out of breath
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself
Is the news good or bad
Answer that question
Tell me if its good or bad and Ill wait for the details
Tell me so I can be satisfied
Is it good or bad
Well you have made a foolish choice
You dont know how to pick a man
Romeo
No not him though his face is more handsome than any mans and his legs are prettier and as for his hands and feet and body theyre not much to speak of and yet theyre beyond compare
Hes not the most polite man in the world but believe me hes gentle as a lamb
Well do what you want
Be good
Have you had lunch yet
No I havent had lunch
Everything you told me I already knew
What does he say about our marriage
What about that
My head is pounding
My back aches too
Believe me Im sorry youre in pain
Sweet sweet sweet Nurse tell me what did my love Romeo say
Your love says like an honorable gentleman who is courteous kind handsome and I believe virtuous where is your mother
Where is my mother
Why shes inside
Where else would she be
Your answer is so strange
Your love says like an honorable gentleman Where is your mother
Are you this impatient
Come on youre being ridiculous
Is this the cure for my aching bones
From now on take care of your messages yourself
Youre making such a fuss
Come on what did Romeo say
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today
I do
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrences cell
Theres a husband there whos waiting to make you his wife
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news
Go to the church
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while its dark
Go
Ill go to lunch
You go to Friar Lawrences cell
Im only trying to keep the peace
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight
What
I hate the word peace like I hate hell all Montagues and you
Lets go at it coward
Use your clubs and spears
Hit them
Beat them down
Down with the Capulets
Down with the Montagues
Whats this noise
I want my sword
Old Montague is here and hes waving his sword around just to make me mad
Capulet you villain
Youre not taking one step toward an enemy
Wish me luck
Thank you dear Nurse
Amen amen
But whatever misfortunes occur they cant ruin the joy I feel with one look at her
Therefore love each other in moderation
That is the key to longlasting love
Too fast is as bad as too slow
Here comes the lady
Oha footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life
Thats how flimsy and unreal pleasure is
Romeo will thank you my girl for both of us
Ill give him equal thanks so were even
Ah Juliet if youre as happy as I am and youre better with words tell me about the happiness you imagine well have in our marriage
I can imagine more than I can sayI have more on my mind than words
Come come with me and well do the job quickly
Im begging you good Mercutio lets call it a day
Youre like one of those guys who walks into a bar slams his sword on the table and then says I pray I never have to use you By the time he orders his second drink he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all
Am I really like one of those guys
Come on you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when youre in the mood
And what about that
If there were two men like you pretty soon thered be none because the two of you would kill each other
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard
Youll fight with a man whos cracking nuts just because you have hazelnutcolored eyes
Only you would look for a fight like that
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun
Didnt you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces
And yet youre the one who wants to teach me about restraint
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are my life insurance rates would be sky high
Your life insurance
Thats foolish
Oh great here come the Capulets
Well well I dont care
Put it together with something else
Make it a word and a blow
Youll find me ready enough to do that sir if you give me a reason
Cant you find a reason without my giving you one
Mercutio you hang out with Romeo
Hang out Who do you think we are musicians in a band
If we look like musicians to you you can expect to hear nothing but noise
Were talking here in a public place
Either go someplace private or talk it over rationally or else just go away
Out here everybody can see us
Mens eyes were made to see things so let them watch
I wont move to please anybody
Well may peace be with you
Here comes my man the man Im looking for
Hes not your man
Tybalt I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult
I am no villain
So goodbye
I can tell that you dont know who I am
Boy your words cant excuse the harm youve done to me
So now turn and draw your sword
And so good Capuletwhich is a name I love like my own nameyou should be satisfied with what I say
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile
What do you want from me
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath
Hurry up or Ill smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn
Ill fight you
Noble Mercutio put your sword away    
Lets get away Tybalt
Ive been hurt
May a plague curse both your families
Im finished
Did he get away clean
What are you hurt
But its enough
Where is my page
Have courage man
The wound cant be that bad
No its not as deep as a well or as wide as a church door but its enough
Ask for me tomorrow and youll find me in a grave
Im done for in this world I believe
May a plague strike both your houses
I cant believe that dog that rat that mouse that cat could scratch me to death
That braggart punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual
Why the hell did you come in between us
He struck me from under your arm
I thought it was the right thing to do
Take me inside some house Benvolio or Ill pass out
May a plague strike both your families
Theyve turned me into food for worms
Im done for
Curse your families
Oh Romeo Romeo brave Mercutio is dead
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again
Hes alive and victorious and Mercutios dead
Either you or I or both of us have to go with him
Wretched boy you hung out with him here and youre going to go to heaven with him
This fight will decide who dies
Romeo get out of here
The citizens are around and Tybalt is dead
Dont stand there shocked
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught
So get out of here
Why are you waiting
The man who killed Mercutio which way did he go
Tybalt that murderer which way did he run
Tybalt is lying over there  
Speak nephew
Were you here when it started
Where are the evil men who started this fight
Oh noble prince I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight
He killed your relative brave Mercutio and then young Romeo killed him
Tybalt was my nephew
He was my brothers son
Oh cousin cousin
Benvolio who started this fight
Romeo cried out Stop my friends
Break it up Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down
Before I could break up the fight Tybalt was killed
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead
Benvolio is part of the Montague family
Hes not telling the truth
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot and together those twenty could only kill one man
You Prince are the man who can give me justice
Romeo killed Tybalt
Romeo must die
Romeo killed Tybalt
Who should now pay the price for Mercutios life
His crime did justices job by taking Tybalts life
Im involved in your rivalry
Ill punish you so harshly that youll regret causing me this loss
I wont listen to your pleas or excuses
You cant get out of trouble by praying or crying so dont bother
Take away this body and do what I say
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders
Or else love is blind and its best time is the night
I wish night would come like a widow dressed in black so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed
Come night
Come Romeo
Youre whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up
Yes yes this is the rope ladder
Oh my whats the news
Why do you look so upset
Hes dead
Were ruined lady were ruined
What an awful day
Can God be so jealous and hateful
Romeo is hateful even though God isnt
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this
This is as bad as the tortures of hell
Has Romeo killed himself
Just say Yes and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye
If hes been killed say Yes If not say No These short words will determine my joy or my pain
Ill send my eyes to prison and theyll never be free to look at anything again
Ill give my vile body back to the earth
Oh Tybalt Tybalt he was the best friend I had
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die
Has Romeo been killed and is Tybalt dead too
Tybalt was my dearest cousin
Tybalt is dead and Romeo has been banished
Oh God did Romeos hand shed Tybalts blood
It did it did
Curse the day this happened but it did
Oh hes like a snake disguised as a flower
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave
Hes a raven with the feathers of the dove
Oh nature what were you doing in hell
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover
Ah wheres my servantGive me some brandyThese griefs these pains these sorrows make me old
Shame on Romeo
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that
He was not born to be shameful
He deserves only honor complete honor
Oh I was such a beast to be angry at him
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin
But why you villain did you kill my cousin
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband
All this is comforting news
Why then should I cry
I would be glad to forget about it but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds
Tybalt is dead and Romeo has been banished
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts
Tybalts death would be bad enough if that was all
It would have been better if after she said Tybalts dead she told me my mother or my father or both were gone
But to say that Tybalts dead and then say Romeo has been banished To say that is like saying that my father my mother Tybalt Romeo and Juliet have all been killed theyre all dead
Romeo has been banished That news brings infinite death
No words can express the pain
Where are my father and my mother Nurse
They are crying and moaning over Tybalts corpse
Are you going to join them
Ill bring you there
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears
Ill cry my tears for Romeos banishment when their tears are dry
Pick up this rope ladder
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed but I am a virgin and I will die a virgin and a widow
And death not Romeo can take my virginity
Go to your bedroom
Ill find Romeo to comfort you
I know where he is
Listen your Romeo will be here tonight
Ill go to him
Hes hiding out in Friar Lawrences cell
Romeo come out
Come out you frightened man
Father whats the news
You know too much about suffering
I have news for you about the Princes punishment
Is the Princes punishment any less awful than doomsday
Ha banishment
Be merciful and say death Exile is much worse than death
Dont say banishment From now on you are banished from Verona
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona except purgatory torture and hell itself
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world and being banished from the world is death
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while Im being murdered
Oh deadly sin
Oh rude and unthankful boy
Its torture not mercy
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo
Flies can kiss her but I must flee the city
Flies are like free men but I have been banished
And yet you say that exile is not death
Did you have no poison no sharp knife no weapon you could use to kill me quickly nothing so disgraceful except banishment
