Oh Friar damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell
They howl about banishment
If youre a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins and you say youre my friend how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment
You foolish madman listen to me for a moment
Your servants were fighting your enemys servants before I got here
I drew my sword to part them
As we were trading blows more and more people showed up to join the fight until the Prince came and broke everyone up
Oh wheres Romeo
Have you seen him today
Im glad he wasnt here for this fight
I headed toward him but he saw me coming and hid in the woods
Hes been seen there many mornings crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs
But as soon as the sun rises in the east my sad son comes home to escape the light
Oh youre just going to talk about banishment again
Dont say anything else
Oh so madmen like you are also deaf
How should madmen hear if wise men cant even see
Let me talk to you about your situation
You cant talk about something that you dont feel
If you were as young as I am if you were in love with Juliet if you had just married her an hour ago if then you murdered Tybalt if you were lovesick like me and if you were banished then you might talk about it
Get up
Somebodys knocking
Hide yourself good Romeo
I wont hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from peoples searching eyes
Why are you knocking so hard
Where do you come from
What do you want
Oh holy Friar Oh tell me holy Friar where is my ladys husband
Wheres Romeo
Oh hes acting just like Juliet just like her
Oh painful sympathy
Shes lying on the ground just like him blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
Stand up if youre really a man
For Juliets sake for her sake rise and stand up
Why should you fall into so deep a moan
Nurse
Ah sir ah sir
Well death is the end for everybody
Were you talking about Juliet
How is she
Where is she
How is she doing
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love
Shes calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her just like I murdered her relative
Tell me Friar in what part of my body is my name embedded
Tell me so I can cut it out of myself 
Are you a man
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast
You have amazed me
I swear by my holy order I thought you were smarter and more rational than this
Have you killed Tybalt
Why do you complain about your birth the heavens and the earth
You have so much natural talent but like someone who hoards money you use none of your talent for the right purposenot your body not your love not your mind
Get up man
Your Juliet is alive
Tybalt wanted to kill you but you killed Tybalt
Be happy that youre alive
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy
But like a misbehaved sullen girl youre whining about your bad luck and your love
Go be with your love as it was decided at your wedding
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her
Give my regards to your lady and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed
Romeo is coming
O Lord I could stay here all night listening to such good advice
Educated men are so impressive
Do so and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me
Here sir this is a ring she asked me to give you
Hurry up its getting late
This makes me feel so much better
Now get out of here
Good night
Everything depends on this either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions or leave in disguise after daybreak
Take a little vacation in Mantua
Ill find your servant and hell update you now and then on your case as it stands here
Give me your hand
Its late
Farewell
Things have turned out so unluckily sir that we havent had time to convince our daughter to marry you
Listen she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly and so did I
Well we were all born to die
These times of pain are bad times for romance
Madam good night
Give my regards to your daughter
I will
Tonight she is shut up in her room alone with her sadness
Sir Paris Ill make a desperate argument for my childs love
Tell her about my son Pariss love for her
And tell her listen to me on WednesdayWaitWhat day is today
Monday my lord
Monday
Ha ha
Do you think its a good idea to rush
We shouldnt have too big a celebrationwe can invite a friend or two
Listen because Tybalt was just killed people might think that we dont care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party
Therefore well have about half a dozen friends to the wedding and thats it
What do you think about Thursday
My lord I wish Thursday were tomorrow
Well go on home
Thursday it is then 
Are you going
Its still a long time until daybreak
That sound you heard was the  It was the lark the bird that sings at dawn not the nightingale
Look my love what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east
Night is over and day is coming
That light is not daylight I know it
Its some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua
So stay for a while
You dont have to go yet
Let me be captured
Let me be put to death
I am content if thats the way you want it
I want to stay more than I want to go
Come death and welcome
Lets talk
Its not daylight
It is it is
Its the lark that sings so out of tune making such harsh noise
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night
Its not true because she separates us
More and more light
More and more pain for us
Madam
Nurse
Your mother is coming to your bedroom
Day has broken
Then the window lets day in and life goes out the window
Farewell farewell
Give me one kiss and Ill go down
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight and makes himself an artificial night
My noble uncle do you know why he acts this way
I dont know and he wont tell me
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason
I hope youre lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around 
Are you gone like that my love my lord
Oh by this count Ill be many years older before I see my Romeo again
Farewell
I wont miss any chance to send my love to you
Oh do you think well ever meet again
Oh God I have a soul that predicts evil things
Now that you are down there you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb
Either my eyesight is failing me or you look pale
And trust me love you look pale to me too
Sadness takes away our color
Goodbye Goodbye
Oh luck luck
Everyone says you cant make up your mind
I hope maybe then youll send him back home soon  
Whos that calling
Is it my mother
What strange reason could she have for coming here
Whats going on Juliet
Madam I am not well
Will you cry about your cousins death forever
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears
If you could you couldnt bring him back to life
So stop crying
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss
You will feel the loss but the man you weep for will feel nothing
Feeling the loss like this I cant help but weep for him forever
Well girl youre weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive
What villain madam
That villain Romeo
Thats because the murderer is alive
Yes madam he lies beyond my reach
I wish that no one could avenge my cousins death except me
Stop crying
Ill send a man to Mantua where that exiled rogue is living
And then I hope youll be satisfied
Ill never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him 
Madam if you can find a man to deliver the poison Ill mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him
Find out the way and Ill find the right man
But now I have joyful news for you girl
And its good to have joy in such a joyless time
Please tell me
Well well you have a careful father child
Madam tell me quickly what day is that
Indeed my child at Saint Peters Church early Thursday morning the gallant young and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride
Now I swear by Saint Peters Church and Peter too he will not make me a joyful bride there
How can I marry him this husband before he comes to court me
Please tell my father madam I wont marry yet
And when I do marry I swear it will be Romeo whom you know I hate rather than Paris
Thats really news
Here comes your father
Tell him so yourself and see how he takes the news
What are you girl
Some kind of fountain
Why are you still crying
Have you told her our decision
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave
How can this be
Isnt she proud of such a match
Doesnt she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom
But I am thankful that you have found it
What is this
What is this fuzzy logic
What is this
I hear you say proud and I thank you and then no thank you and not proud you spoiled little girl
You disgust me you little bug
You worthless girl
You pale face
Shame on you
What are you crazy
Good father Im begging you on my knees be patient and listen to me say just one thing
Dont say anything
Dont reply
Dont talk back to me
She disgusts me the little hussy
God in heaven bless her
My lord youre wrong to berate her like that
And why wise lady
Go blabber with your gossiping friends
Ive said nothing wrong
Oh for Gods sake
Cant I say something
Be quiet you mumbling fool
We dont need to hear it
Youre getting too angry
Goddammit
It makes me mad
Day and night hour after hour all the time at work at play alone in company my top priority has always been to find her a husband
Thursday is coming
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice
If you act like my daughter Ill marry you to my friend
Think about it
I wont break this promise
Delay this marriage for a month or a week
Or if you dont delay make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies
Dont talk to me because I wont say a word
Do as you please because Im done worrying about you
Oh GodOh Nurse how can this be stopped
My husband is alive on earth my vows of marriage are in heaven
How can I bring those promises back down to earth unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven
Give me comfort
Dont you have one word of joy
Give me some comfort Nurse
Oh hes a lovely gentleman
Romeos a dishcloth compared to him
Madam an eagle does not have eyes as green as quick and as fair as the eyes of Paris
Curse my very heart but I think you should be happy in this second marriage because its better than your first
Even if its not better your first marriage is over
Are you speaking from your heart
Amen
What
Well you have given me great comfort
I made my father angry so I went to Friar Lawrences cell to confess and be forgiven
Alright I will
Oh that most wicked fiend
Im going to the Friar to find out his solution
If everything else fails at least I have the power to take my own life
On Thursday sir
Thats very soon
You say you dont know what the girl thinks
I dont like it
Now you know the reason for the rush
Look sir here comes the lady walking toward my cell
Im happy to meet you my lady and my wife
That might be the case sir 
Good morning cousin
Is it that early in the day
Its only just now nine oclock
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry
It was
I dont have the thing that makes time fly
Youre in love
Out
Out of love
So where should we eat 
That may be must be love on Thursday
What must be will be
That is a certain truth
Have you come to make confession to this father
If I answered that question Id be making confession to you
Dont deny to him that you love me
Ill confess to you that I love him
You will also confess Im sure that you love me
If I do so it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face
You poor soul your face has suffered many tears
Your face is mine and you have slandered it
I have time for you now my sad daughter
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion
Oh Juliet I already know about your sad situation
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday and that nothing can delay it
Dont tell me that youve heard about this marriage Friar unless you can tell me how to prevent it
If you who are so wise cant help please be kind enough to call my solution wise 
Hold on then
Tomorrow is Wednesday
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone
Dont let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom 
Give me the vial
Give it to me
Love will give me strength and strength will help me accomplish this plan
Goodbye dear Father
You wont get any bad cooks from me
How can you test them like that
So the cooks who cant lick their fingers arent hired
Go get out of here
Were unprepared for this wedding celebration
Yes thats true
Look shes come home from confession with a happy look on her face
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness
Send for the Count
Go tell him about this
Ill make this wedding happen tomorrow morning
I met the young man at Lawrences cell
Well Im glad about this
This is good
Stand up
Yes alright go I say and bring him here
Now before God our whole city owes this friar a great debt
Nurse will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry Ill need to wear tomorrow
No not until Thursday
Theres plenty of time
Well have the wedding at the church tomorrow
Its already almost night
And everything will be alright I promise you wife
You should go to Juliet and dress her up
Im not going to bed tonight
Leave me alone
Ill pretend to be the housewife for once
Yes those are the best clothes
What are you busy
Do you need my help
Im sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities
Good night
Only God knows when well meet again
In my desperate situation I have to act alone
Alright heres the vial
What if this mixture doesnt work at all
Will I be married tomorrow morning
Lie down right there  
Oh look
I think I see my cousin Tybalts ghost
Wait Tybalt wait
Romeo Romeo Romeo
Heres a drink
I drink to you
No cousin Im crying
Good man why are you crying
Yes this is what love does
What else is love
Its a sweet lozenge that you choke on
Goodbye cousin
Wait
Ill come with you
If you leave me like this youre doing me wrong
Im not myself
Im not here
Tell me seriously who is the one you love
You mean I should groan and tell you
Groan
No
But tell me seriously who it is
Take these keys and get more spices Nurse
Theyre calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen
Come on wake up wake up wake up
The second cock crowed
The curfewbell rang
Dont worry about the cost
Go you old housewife go
Go to bed dear
Youll be sick tomorrow because youve stayed up all night
Ive stayed up all night many times before for less important matters and Ive never gotten sick
Yes youve been a ladies man in your time
A jealous woman a jealous woman
Now fellow what have you got there
Hurry up hurry up
Im smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter
Right and well said
That guys funny
Goodness its daylight
Wife
What
Hey Nurse
Go wake Juliet
Go and get her dressed
Ill go and chat with Paris
Hey hurry up hurry up
The bridegroom is already here
Hurry up I say
Mistress
Hey mistress
I bet shes fast asleep
Hey lady
Hey love I say
Madam
Sweetheart
Hey bride
What you dont say a word
You take your beauty sleep now
How sound asleep she is
Yes let the count take you in your bed
Hell wake you up I bet
Wont he
Whats all the noise in here
Oh sad day
What is the matter
Look look
Oh what a sad day
Oh my Oh my
My child my reason for living wake up look up or Ill die with you
For shame bring Juliet out here
Her bridegroom is here
Shes dead deceased shes dead
Curse the day
Curse the day
Shes dead shes dead shes dead
No
Let me see her
Oh no
Shes cold
Her blood has stopped and her joints are stiff
Shes been dead for some time
Shes dead like a beautiful flower killed by an unseasonable frost
Oh sad day
Oh this is a painful time
Death which has taken her away to make me cry now ties up my tongue and wont let me speak
Come is the bride ready to go to church
Shes ready to go but shell never return 
Death is my soninlaw
Death is my heir
My daughter married death
I will die and leave Death everything
Life wealth everything belongs to Death
Have I waited so long to see this morning only to see this
Accursed unhappy wretched hateful day
This is the most miserable hour of all time
I had only one child one poor child one poor and loving child the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself and cruel Death has stolen it from me
Oh pain
Oh painful painful painful day
There has never been so black a day as today
Oh painful day Oh painful day
She was tricked divorced wronged spited killed
Cruel cruel Death killed her
Oh love
Oh life
There is no life but my love is dead
Despised distressed hated martyred killed
Why did this have to happen now
My soul and not my child
You are dead
Be quiet for shame
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming
You had this child with the help of heaven
Now heaven has her
She is in a better place
You could not prevent her from dying someday but heaven will give her eternal life
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladderthat was your idea of heaven
And now you cry even though she has risen up above the clouds as high as heaven itself
Oh in this love you love your child so badly that you go mad even though she is in heaven
It is best to marry well and die young better than to be married for a long time
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave
Dont disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heavens will
Well we can put away our pipes and go home
Yes well things could get better
No not a sad song
Its not the right time to play
You wont then
No
Then Ill really give it to you
What will you give us
No money I swear
Ill call you a minstrel
Then Ill call you a servingcreature
Then Ill smack you on the head with the servingcreatures knife
Ill make you sing
Do you hear me
Answer me like men
Well sir because silver has a sweet sound
Another studpid answer
What do you say James  Well I dont know what to say
Ill answer for you
It is music with her silver sound because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds
What an annoying man this guy is
Forget about him Jack
If I can trust my dreams then some joyful news is coming soon
Oh my
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love when merely thinking about love makes me so happy
Do you have news from VeronaWhat is it Balthasar
Do you bring me a letter from the friar
How is my wife
Is my father well
How is my Juliet
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well
Then she is well and nothing is wrong
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven
I saw her buried in her familys tomb and then I came here to tell you the news
Oh pardon me for bringing this bad news but you told me it was my job sir
You wouldnt tell a sick man he seriously has to make his willit would just make him worse
Seriously cousin I love a woman
Then you were right on target
The woman I love is beautiful
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest
Well youre not on target there
Yes she has and by keeping celibate she wastes her beauty
Shes too beautiful and too wise to deserve heavens blessing by making me despair
Take my advice
Dont think about her
Teach me to forget to think
Is it really true
Then I rebel against you stars
You know where I live
Get me some ink and paper and hire some horses to ride
I will leave here for Verona tonight
Please sir have patience
You look pale and wild as if youre going to hurt yourself
Tsk youre wrong
Leave me and do what I told you to do
Dont you have a letter for me from the friar
No my good lord
No matter
Get on your way and hire those horses
Ill be with you right away
Well Juliet Ill lie with you tonight
Lets see how
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men
As I remember this should be the house
Todays a holiday so the beggars shop is shut
Hey
Pharmacist
Whos that calling so loud
Come here man
I see that you are poor
Here are forty ducats
Youre this poor and wretched and still afraid to die
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger
I can see in your eyes that youre starving
The world is not your friend and neither is the law
The world doesnt make laws to make you rich
I pay you because youre poor not because you want me to buy this    
Holy Franciscan Friar
Brother hey
That sounds like the voice of Friar John
Welcome back from Mantua
What does Romeo say
Or if he wrote down his thoughts give me his letter
I couldnt go to Mantua because I was stuck there
Then who took my letter to Romeo
Unhappy fortune
Brother Ill go and bring it to you
Now I must go to the tomb alone
Within three hours Juliet will wake up
But Ill write again to Mantua and Ill keep her in my cell until Romeo comes
Shes shut inside a dead mans tomb
Give me your torch boy
Go away and stay apart from me
Put the torch out so I cant be seen
Give me those flowers
Do as I tell you
Go
The boy is warning me that someone approaches
Whos ruining my rituals of true love
Its someone with a torch
I must hide in the darkness for awhile
Give me that pickax and the crowbar
Ill go sir and I wont bother you
Thats the way to show me friendship
Take this 
Good and noble young man dont mess with someone whos desperate
Get away from here and leave me
Think about the ones who have died
Let them put fear in your heart
Please young man dont make me angry
Oh go away
Dont stay here go away
Live and from now on say a madman mercifully told you to run away
Im arresting you as a criminal
Are you going to provoke me
Alright lets fight boy
Oh Lord theyre fighting
Ill go call the watch
Alright I will
Its Mercutios relative noble Count Paris
What did my man say
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet
Isnt that what he said
Or was I dreaming
Ill bury you in a magnificent grave
A grave
Oh no
Juliet lies here and her beauty fills this tomb with light
Death has sucked the honey from your breath but it has not yet ruined your beauty
You havent been conquered
Oh what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young
Should I believe that death is in love with you and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress
Here here Ill remain with worms that are your chambermaids
Oh Ill rest here forever
Eyes look out for the last time
Arms make your last embrace
His drugs work quickly
So I die with a kiss
Look at other beautiful girls
Saint Francis help me
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones
Im a friend a friend who knows you well
God bless you
Tell me my good friend what is that light over there
It looks to me like its burning in the Capulet tomb
Who is it
Romeo
How long has he been there
For a full half hour
Go with me to the tomb
I dont dare sir
Stay then
Ill go alone
Im suddenly afraid
Oh Im very scared something awful has happened
As I slept under this yewtree here I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb
Oh friendly friar
Where is my husband
I remember very well where I should be and here I am
Where is my Romeo
I hear some noise
Lady come out of the tomb
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan
Come come away
Your husband lies dead there and Paris too
Come Ill place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns
Its a cup closed in my true loves hand
Poison I see has been the cause of his death
I will kiss your lips
Perhaps theres still some poison on them to make me die with a medicinal kiss
Oh noise
Then Ill be quick
Oh good a knife
Rust inside my body and let me die
This is the place
There where the torch is burning
The ground is bloody
This is a pitiful sight
Go tell the Prince
Run to the Capulets
Wake up the Montagues
Have some others search
Heres Romeos man
We found him in the churchyard
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here
Here is a friar whos trembling sighing and weeping
We took this pickax and this shovel from him as he was walking from this side of the graveyard
Very suspicious
Hold the friar too
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time
Whats the problem that they cry out so loud
Some people in the street are crying Romeo Some are crying Juliet and some are crying Paris Theyre all running in an open riot toward our tomb
Investigate how this foul murder came about
Oh heavens
Oh wife look at how our daughter bleeds
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montagues back but instead its missheathed in my daughters breast
Oh my
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me Im old and Ill die soon
Oh my liege my wife died tonight
Sadness over my sons exile stopped her breath
What further pain must I endure in my old age
Look and youll see  
And then Ill be the leader of pain and maybe Ill lead you as far as death
In the meantime hold on and be patient
I am the greatest but I was able to do the least
I have already condemned and excused myself
Tell us what you know about this affair
I will be brief because Im not going to live long enough to tell a boring story
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off
I know all of this
I brought my master news of Juliets death
Give me the letter
Oh brother Montague give me your hand
But what do you say to my request
I can only repeat what Ive said before
My daughter is still very young
Shes not even fourteen years old
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon
But go ahead and charm her gentle Paris make her love you
Tonight Im having a feast that weve celebrated for many years
At my humble house tonight you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below
In the beautiful city of Verona where our story takes place a longstanding hatred between two families erupts into new violence and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents feud
Come along with me
Find the people whose names are on this list
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others tools that fisherman should play with paints and painters should play with with fishing nets
But Ive been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list and I cant read
But here come some people right in the nick of time  
For when you cut your shin
What
Romeo are you crazy
Im locked up in a prison and deprived of food
Im whipped and tortured May God give you a good evening
Excuse me sir do you know how to read
I can read my own fortune in my misery
Perhaps youve learned from life and not from books
But please tell me can you read anything you see
Yes if I know the language and the letters
I see
Well thats an  Stay fellow
I can read
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters Vitruvios widow Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces Mercutio and his brother Valentine My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters My fair niece Rosaline and Livia
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt Lucio and the lively Helena Thats a nice group of people
Where are they supposed to come
Up
Where
To supper
To our house
Whose house
My masters house
Indeed I should have asked you before who he was
Now Ill tell you so you dont have to ask
My master is the great and rich Capulet and if you dont belong to the house of Montague please come and drink a cup of wine
Have a nice day
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulets traditional feast along with every beautiful woman in Verona
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls Ill show you
A woman more beautiful than the one I love
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began
Ill go with you
Nurse wheres my daughter
Tell her to come to me
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve I already told her to come
Come on
Whos calling me
Your mother
Madam Im here
What do you want
You know how young my daughter is
Yes I know her age down to the hour
Shes not even fourteen
Id bet fourteen of my own teethbut Im sorry to say I only have four teethshes not fourteen
Whether its even or odd of all the days in the year on the night of Lammas Eve shell be fourteen
She and SusanGod rest her and all Christian soulswere born on the same day
Well Susan died and is with God
She was too good for me
But like I said on the night of Lammas Eve she will be fourteen
Yes she will
Indeed I remember it well
Its been eleven years since the earthquake
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun under the wall of the dovehouse
But like I said when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake
There was no need to tell me to get out of there
Oh he said Did you fall on your face
Youll  Enough of this
Please be quiet
Yes madam
But I cant help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said Yes I swear she had a bump on her forehead as big as a roosters testicle
It was a painful bruise and she was crying bitterly
Yes said my husband Did you fall on your face
Youll fall backward when you grow up wont you Jule And she stopped crying and said Yes Now you stop too Nurse please
May God choose you to receive his grace
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed
If I live to see you get married someday all my wishes will come true
Tell me my daughter Juliet what is your attitude about getting married
It is an honor that I do not dream of
Well start thinking about marriage now
Here in Verona there are girls younger than yougirls from noble familieswho have already become mothers
By my count I was already your mother at just about your age while you remain a virgin
Well then Ill say this quickly the valiant Paris wants you as his bride
What a man young lady
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him
Lose nothing
Ill look at him and try to like him at least if what I see is likable
But I wont let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows
Everythings out of control
Please follow straight after me
Well follow you
Go girl look for a man wholl give you happy nights at the end of happy days
What will we say is our excuse for being here
Or should we enter without apologizing
Its out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that
Let them judge us however they please
Give me a torch
I dont want to dance
No noble Romeo youve got to dance
Not me believe me
Youre wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles
My soul is made out of lead and its so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I cant move
Youre a lover
Take Cupids wings and fly higher than the average man
His arrow has pierced me too deeply so I cant fly high with his cheerful feathers
I sink under the heavy weight of love
We wont take their garbage
I hit hard when Im angry
Angry enough to run away
You wont stand and fight
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand
If you sink youre dragging love down
Is love really tender
I think its too rough too rude too rowdy and it pricks like a thorn
If love plays rough with you play rough with  Come on lets knock and go in
Let playful people with light hearts dance
Come on were wasting precious daylight
Lets go
No were notits night
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball but its not smart of us to go
Why may I ask
I had a dream last night
So did I
Well what was your dream
My dream told me that dreamers often lie
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth
Oh then I see youve been with  Whos Queen Mab
Sometimes she rides over a courtiers lips and he dreams of making money off of someone
Sometimes she tickles a priests nose with a  Enough enough
Mercutio be quiet
The wind youre talking about is blowing us off our course
Dinner is over and were going to get there too late
Onward lover boys
Beat the drum
Wheres Potpan
When only one or two men have all the good manners and even they are dirty things are bad
Take away the stools the sideboards and the plates
You good friend save me a piece of marzipan and if you love me have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell
Yes boy Im ready
Theyre looking for you in the great chamber
We cant be in two places at once both here and there
Cheers boys
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything
Welcome gentlemen
Whichever of you acts shy Ill swear she has corns
Welcome gentlemen
I swear it must be thirty years
Its been longer its been longer
Lucentios son is older than that sir
Hes thirty years old
Are you really going to tell me that
His son was a minor only two years ago
I dont know sir
Oh she shows the torches how to burn bright
My eyes were liars then because I never saw true beauty before tonight
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague
Why are you acting so angry
Uncle this man is a Montagueour enemy
Is it young Romeo
Thats him that villain Romeo
Calm down gentle cousin
Leave him alone
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman and to tell you the truth he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and wellbehaved young man
I wouldnt insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town
So calm down
Just ignore him
I wont tolerate him
You  But uncle were being disrespected
Go on go on
Youre an insolent little boy
Is that how it is really
I know what Ill do
You have to contradict me do you
Ill teach you a lesson
Dont saints and pilgrims have lips too
Yes pilgrimthey have lips that theyre supposed to pray with
Well then saint let lips do what hands do
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesnt turn to despair
Saints dont move even when they grant prayers
Then dont move while I act out my prayer
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours
Sin from my lips
Give me my sin back
You kiss like youve studied how
Madam your mother wants to talk to you
Who is her mother
I nursed her daughter whom you were just talking to
Let me tell you the man who marries her will become very wealthy
No gentlemen dont get ready to go now
We have a little dessert coming up 
Youre right
The fight is between our masters and we men who work for them
Its all the same
Ill be a harsh master to them
Cut off their heads
You mean their  Cut off their heads take their maidenheadswhatever
Take my remark in whichever sense you like
The women you rape are the ones wholl have to sense it
Everybody knows Im a nice piece of flesh
Its a good thing youre not a piece of fish
Youre    Pull out your tool now
I have my naked sword out
Come over here nurse
Who is that gentleman
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio
Whos the one whos going out the door right now
Well that one I think is young Petruchio
I dont know his name
Go ask
Whats this
Whats this
The strangers are all gone
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman whos supposed to be his enemy
And Juliets just as much in love as he but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover
But love gives them power and time gives them the chance to meet sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure
Can I go away while my heart stays here
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall
Call to him Mercutio
Ill conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit
Romeo
Show yourself in the form of a sigh
Speak one rhyme and Ill be satisfied
Just cry out Ah me Just say love and dove Say just one lovely word to my good friend 
If he hears you youll make him angry
What Im saying cant anger him
The things Im saying are fair and honest
His love is blind so it belongs in the dark
If love is blind it cant hit the target
Now hell sit under a  Lets go
Theres no point in looking for him if he doesnt want to be found
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Virginity makes her look sick and green
Let it go
Oh theres my lady
Oh it is my love
Oh I wish she knew how much I love her
Shes talking but shes not saying anything
So what
Her eyes are saying something
Shes not talking to me
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business and theyre asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return
If her eyes were in the night sky they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing thinking her light was the light of day
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek
Oh I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek
Oh my
Who are you
I hate my name dear saint because my name is your enemy
Arent you Romeo
And arent you a Montague
Tell me how did you get in here
And why did you come
If any of my relatives find you here theyll kill you because of who you are
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle
If they see you theyll murder you
Just look at me kindly and Im invincible against their hatred
Id give anything to keep them from seeing you here
Id rather they killed me than have to live without your love
Otherwise youd see me blushing about the things youve heard me say tonight
Do you love me
I know youll say yes and Ill believe you
What should I swear by
Dont swear at all
But if you have to swear swear by your wonderful self which is the god I worship like an idol and then Ill believe you
If my hearts dear love Well dont swear
Although you bring me joy I cant take joy in this exchange of promises tonight
Our love which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart
Oh are you going to leave me so unsatisfied
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to
Yet I wish I could take that promise back so I had it to give again
You would take it back
Why would you do that my love
Only to be generous and give it to you once more
But Im wishing for something I already have
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea and my love is as deep
I hear a noise inside
Sweet Montague be true
Stay here for a moment
Ill come back
Oh blessed blessed night
Because its dark out Im afraid all this is just a dream too sweet to be real
Three words dear Romeo and then its good night for real
Dont worry about me
I  Lets not break the law by starting a fight
Let them start something
Ill frown at them as they pass by and they can react however they want
You mean however they dare
Ill bite my thumb at them
Hey are you biting your thumb at us
Im biting my thumb
Are you biting your thumb at us
Are you trying to start a fight
Start a fight
No sir
Tomorrow Ill send the messenger
My soul depends on it A thousand times good night
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you
Oh I wish I could make a  My soul is calling out my name
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silversweet
Romeo
My baby hawk
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you
By nine oclock
I wont fail
From now until then seems like twenty years
I have forgotten why I called you back
Let me stand here until you remember your reason
Ill forget that I have any home besides this spot right here
Its almost morning
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string
I wish I was your bird
My sweet so do I
But I would kill you by petting you too much
Good night good night
Parting is such sweet sorrow that Ill say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow
I hope you sleep peacefully
I wish I were Sleep and Peace so I could spend the night with you
Now Ill go see my priest to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck
Darkness is stumbling out of the suns path like a drunk man
Now before the sun comes up and burns away the dew I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers
The Earth is natures mother and also natures tomb
From the Earths womb many different sorts of plants and animals come forth and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment
Herbs plants and stones possess great power
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality
Virtue turns to vice if its misused
Inside the little rind of this weak flower there is both poison and powerful medicine
There are two opposite elements in everything in men as well as in herbsgood and evil
When evil is dominant death soon kills the body like cancer
Good morning father
God bless you
Who greets me so early in the morning
Young man somethings wrong if youre getting out of bed this early
Every old man has worries and worried men never get any sleep but young men shouldnt have a care in the world
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep
Therefore the fact that youre awake this early tells me youve been upset with some anxiety
If thats not the case then this must be the answer You Romeo have not been to bed tonight
Your last guess is right
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep
With Rosaline father
Thats good my boy
But where have you been
Ill tell you before you have to ask me again
You have the sacred power to cure both of us
I carry no hatred holy man because my request will benefit my enemy
Here comes your father
Dont even think about refusing
I must and will have Katherine for my wife
Now Signior Petruchio how are you getting on with my daughter
Beautifully sir beautifully
Now daughter Katherine
Are you down in the dumps
You have the nerve to call me daughter
Sir this is the truth you and the restall the people who have ever talked about herhave all been wrong
She has the patience of a  Ill see you hanged on Sunday first
Listen to that Petruchio she says shell see you hanged first
Is this your idea of success
So much for our plan
Relax gentlemen
Ive made my choice
If she and I are happy whats it to you
When we were alone we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant
I tell you though its incredible how much she loves me
Darling Kate
You men are rank beginners
Give me your hand Kate
Im off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding
God give you joy Petruchio
Call it a match
Amen to that
Well be your witnesses
Father wife friendsfarewell
Im off to Venice
Sunday is just around the corner
Were to be married on Sunday
Was there ever a match put together so quickly
Ive made a risky investment
The only profit I seek is a peaceful match
Theres no doubt that Petruchios got quite a catch
Now Baptista lets turn to your younger daughter
Weve been waiting a long time for this day
Im your neighbor and came courting first
Callow youth you dont yet know how to love
And youre all sizzle
Stand back boy
Age is the thing that nourishes
Enough gentlemen
I will settle this matter 
First of all my house in the city as you know is filled with expensive furniture and household articles china and gold basins and pitchers for her to wash her dainty hands in
Then at my farm I have a hundred milk cows a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables and all the equipment necessary to maintain them
Two thousand ducats a year from his land 
I cant offer her more than all I have
I must admit your offer is the best
Otherwiseforgive me but if you should die before him what becomes of her dowry
Oh and young men never die
As you know next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married 
I believe your Honor is thinking of a character called Soto
Yes that was it
You gave an excellent performance
There is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight
Go lad and take them to the pantry
Farewell good neighbor
Your father would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining years as a guest in your house
Its absurd
An old Italian fox is never that generous my boy
Sneaky driedup old coot
Usually fathers produce children not the other way around
But in this case of wooing a child shall father his own fatherif my wits dont fail me
Ill have my lessons in the order and manner 
Where did we leave off
Here madam     Translate
Now let me see if I can translate it
Theres no need to be really for  Youre my teacher so I must believe you
But let it goNow Litio its your turn
I hope sir that youre not angry that Ive been equally attentive to you both  
You call this a scale
I dont like it
I like doing things the oldfashioned way
Mistress your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sisters room
You know tomorrow is her wedding day
Farewell to both of you dear teachers
I have to go
But theres reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster
He acts like a man in love
The humiliation is all mine
So now everyone will point at me and say Look there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchioif he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing  
Maybe but I wish Id never laid eyes on him
Go daughter
I cannot blame you now for weeping
Master master
I have newsold news such as you never heard before
You say you have news thats old
How can that be
Well is it not news that Petruchios coming
Is he here
Why no sir
What then
He is coming
When will he be here
When he stands where I am and sees you there  
Who comes with him
Hes dressed like a freak a total freak and not at all like a proper footman or a gentlemans valet
I am glad hes coming however hes dressed
Why sir hes not coming
Didnt you just say he was
Who
Petruchio
Yes Petruchio
No I said his horse is coming with him on its back
Well thats the same thing
No by Saint Jamy Ill bet you a penny
You are welcome sir
Ill give you more instructions later
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures
I cant wait to hear him call the drunkard husband and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant
Ill go and coach them
Where is my lovely bride
Why sir you know this is your wedding day
Its a long storyand tough to listen to
But where is Kate
Were wasting time here
Dont greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes
Go to my room and put on something of mine
Not me
Ill see her like this
But surely youre not planning to 
Yes just like this
Though I expect shell wear me out more quickly than Ill wear out what Im wearingwhich will be good for her and even better for me
But what a fool I am to stand here chatting when I should bid good morning to my bride and seal the bargain with a loving kiss
He must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason
Ill try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church if its at all possible
Ill go too and make sure that happens
And 
Well outwit them allthat old geezer Gremio the suspicious father Minola the prim musician lover Litioall for the sake of my master Lucentio
Signior Gremio are you coming from the church
As eagerly as I ever came from school
Bridegroom
No hes a devila devil I tell you
Why shes a lamb a dove a child compared to him
She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him
Finally the ceremony done he called for wine
Next he slung his arm around the brides neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo
That was the limit for me
Its disgraceful
There go the minstrels
Youre not thinking of leaving tonight surely
Not tonighttoday
If you knew the reason youd understand and would urge me to go rather than stay
Good friends I thank you all for coming to see me wed this patient sweet virtuous wife
Goodbye to you all
Cant do it
As a favor to  Nope
As a favor to  Im delighted
Delighted to stay
Delighted to hear you ask so nicely but I wont stay in any case
Look if you love me stay
Grumio get me my horse
Yes sir theyre ready
Theyve eaten themselves sick
The door is open sir
Go on wear your boots out
As for me Ill leave when I like
Calm down Kate
Please dont be angry
I will be angry
What business is it of yoursFather be quiet
Hell stay as long as I say
Okay now it starts
Gentlemen on to the bridal dinner
I see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesnt have nerve enough to stand up for herself
They 
No let them go
Theyre certainly a peaceful couple
That since shes mad herself shes married a madman
Neighbors and friends though we dont have anyone for the bride and bridegrooms places at the table you know theres nothing missing in the feast itself
She shall Lucentio
Come gentlemen lets go in
To hell with all wornout horses all crazy masters and all bad roads
Was a man ever beaten as much as me
Was a man ever as dirty as me
Was a man ever so tired
I have been sent on ahead to light a fire and they are coming after to warm themselves
Its a good thing Im like a little pot and warm up quickly or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth my tongue to the roof of my mouth and my heart would freeze in my belly before I managed to get thawed out
Ill warm myself by blowing on the fire
Who calls so coldly
A piece of ice
Trust me you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck
Start the fire good Curtis
Are my master and his wife coming Grumio
Yes yes Curtis so hurry up and start the fire
Leave out the water
Is she as fiery a shrew as they say
Well she was good Curtis before this frost
Your horn is a foot long and Im at least that size
So tell me Grumio how goes the world
Therefore do your duty and take your reward because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death
The fire is ready
So go on tell me the news
I think Im getting delirious
Wheres the cook
Is supper ready
Are all the cups and glasses in their places the tablecloths laid outeverything in order
For Gods sake would someone bring me a mug of beer
Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit
What garment would your Honor like to wear today
Im Christopher Sly
Everythings ready
So tell me whats been going on
Well first of all my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out
How
From their saddles into the dirtbut thats another story
Well lets have it Grumio
Lean forward
Here
There
This is to feel the news not hear it
Thats what makes it sensitive news
I was just knocking to see if anyone was home
Now Ill begin first we came down a steep hill my master riding behind my mistress Both on one horse
Whats the difference
Well the difference of a horse
Its too bad
Yesas you and the rest will find out as soon as hes home
But why am I telling you this
Get them in hereNathaniel Joseph Nicholas Philip Walter Sugarsop and the rest
Tell them to slick down their hair brush their blue coats and make sure their socks match
Have them click their heels together and dont dare touch a hair of the masters horses tail till they kiss their hands
Are they all ready
They are
Get them in here  
She already has a face
Yeah so
You just said they had to face her
I meant they had to give her credit
Shes not going to borrow money from them
Welcome home Grumio
Whats up Grumio
Hey Grumio
My man Grumio
So whats the story old boy
Any minute
Where are those bastards
Here here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir You stupid unpolished dolts
Where is the fool I sent on ahead
Here sir as foolish as ever
You unwashed farmworker
You bastard workhorse drudge
Didnt I tell you to meet me outside and bring these morons with you
Nathaniels coat was being fixed sir
And Walter couldnt get his dagger out of its sheath
Only Adam Rafe and Gregory were ready
Go blockheads go and bring my supper to me  
Where are my slippers
Can we have some water please here Come and wash Kate make yourself at home
Take it easy
Please
It was just an accident
Will you say grace sweet Kate or shall IWhat is this
Mutton
Yes
Who brought it out here
I did
You bastards
Where is that moron of a cook
How dare you serve it to me this way
There take it all backplates cups the whole thing
Please dear calm down
The meat was fine if you wanted to eat it
And Im telling you it was burnt and dried out
Come Ill show you your bridal chamber
Peter did you ever see anything like it
Hes giving her a taste of her own medicine
Where is he
Look out hes coming
Well Ive begun my reign with a carefully thoughtout plan and I have every hope of succeeding
My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me for if her hunger is satisfied shell pay no attention to the bait
I have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owners call is to keep her from sleeping
the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey
She had no food today and will have none
Last night she got no sleep and she wont get any tonight
Just as I did with the meat Ill make up some problem with the way the bed is made and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other and the blanket over here and the sheets over there
And if she starts to drop off Ill rant and yell until I wake her up
If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew speak up please
It would be much appreciated
What are you reading teacher
Answer me that first
I hope youre an expert in your field      
Let me come clean
Im not really Litio
My name is Hortensio sir
Look how they kiss and carry on
The hell with her
Look how she carries on with him
Its revolting
Well to be on the safe sideso I dont go back on my promiseI plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days
Farewell then Signior Lucentio
From now on goodness in women not superficial beauty will win my heart
What are you trying to make me crazy
Im Christopher Sly son of old Sly of BartononHeath a peddler by birth a  Oh this is why your poor wife is mourning
And this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow
Oh noble lord consider your lineage
Look how your servants wait on you each one ready to do whatever you command
Would you care to hear some music
Listen
Do you want to sleep
Well have a couch made up thats softer and more fragrant even than the bed of lustful 
Youre busted
Hortensio and I have given you up
You cant mean it Tranio
Have you both really given me up
Yes maam we have
So Litios out of the picture
Hes going after a young widow
Well good for him
Yeah and hes going to tame her
Is that what he says
The taming school
Is there such a place
Master master Ive been on the lookout so long Im ready to fall down deadbut Ive got one finally
What does he look like Biondello
And what about him Tranio
Go take your sweetheart and leave him to me
May God keep you well sir
This is it for now
Mantua
Killed
Why
That would be a little extreme
Its a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua
Didnt you know
Its strange that you havent heard
I have promissory notes from Florence that I have to deliver
Oh yes sir I have often been to PisaPisa City of Wise Men
Oh sir I accept
And Ill be eternally grateful to you  
No no I cant really
The more I suffer the more spiteful he becomes
Did he marry me just to starve me
And if they dont find charity there they find it someplace else
But I who have never known how to beg and never had to beg am starved for food dizzy with lack of sleep kept awake with curses and fed with brawling
And what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of loveas though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death
What do you say to a calfs foot
Oh lovely
Can I have some
Im afraid it will  Id love it
Nice Grumio bring me some
I dont know
Im afraid it will make you too hot too
What do you say to a piece of beef with mustard
Yes but the mustard is probably too hot
Well then the beef without the mustard
Absolutely not
Youll take the mustard or youll get no beef from Grumio
Then both or one or anything you like
How about the mustard without the beef
Get out of here you measly lying wretch
Cheer up
Give us a smile
Look love see how devoted I am
I am sure sweet Kate this kindness deserves thanks
What not a word
I guess you dont want it
Here take away the dish
Please leave it here
Thank you sir
Come mistress Kate Ill join you
Now tailor lets see what youve got
Lay out the gown
What can I do for you sir
Here is the cap your Worship ordered
Why this was modeled on a porridge bowl
No definitely not
Its cheap and nasty
Its like a cockleshell or a walnut shell a joke a prank a dolls cap
Take it away
Bring me a bigger one
I wont have one any bigger
When you are gentle you shall have one too and not till then
Sir I think I have the right to speak and speak I certainly will
I am not a child or an infant
Better men than you have heard me speak my mind and if you cant take it then youd better plug your ears
You know youre right
Its a measly little cap a dessert crust a plaything a silk pie
I love you all the more for not liking it
I dont care if you love me or not I like the cap and Ill have it or I wont have any
Now your gown
Yes yes
Come tailor show it to us
Merciful God
What do you call this
A sleeve
Its like a cannon
Carved it up and down like an apple tart
Snip and snip and cut and slashits got more holes than a sieve
What in the world do you call this tailor
You told me to make it well and properly and in keeping with the current style
Certainly I did
But if you remember I didnt tell you to parody the style
I wont take it
Do whatever you want with it
I never saw a betterdesigned gown more elegant and pleasing and well made
Yes thats it
Its a lie you thread you thimble you measurement
You flea you louse you winter cricket
Disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread
I tell you youve ruined her gown
Its not true
The gown was made just as my master was directed
Grumio gave the order for how it should be done
I gave him no order
I gave him the material
But how did you want it made
With a needle and thread
But didnt you expect us to cut the cloth
Well dont face off with me
You have bested many things well dont try and best me
I will not be faced or bested
I tell you I requested that your master cut out the gown but I didnt ask him to cut it all to pieces
Why here is the order to prove it
Read it
The note is a big fat liar if it says I said so  
Do you like pictures
You have a noble wife who is much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining age
Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face she was the fairest creature in the worldand even now she has no equal
I admit the cape
I admit two sleeves
Ah theres the problem
Error in the bill sir error in the bill
I ordered that the sleeves be cut out and sewed up again and Ill prove it in combat even if your little finger is armed with your thimble
I am ready for you
You take the bill and Ill take your yardstick
God have mercy Grumio
He wont have a chance
Well sir the gown is not for me
You are right its for my mistress
Go take it away and let your master make whatever use of it he can
Certainly not
Take off my mistress gown for your masters use
Why whats the problem
Oh sir the problem goes far deeper than you realize
Take up my mistress gown for his masters use
Oh thats disgusting
Ah well my Kate
I mean is the jay more precious than the lark because his feather is more beautiful
Is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye
Hardly Kate
If you regard it as shameful put the shame on me
Were off to eat and whoop it up at your fathers house
I hate to say it but its almost two and we wont get there before suppertime
It shall be seven oclock before I get on my horse
Whatever I say or think or do youre continually contradicting it
Sirs never mind
We wont go todayor any day until its clear that it shall be whatever time I say it is  
Yes certainly
Unless I am mistaken Signior Baptista may remember me from the Pegasus in Genoa where we both stayed twenty years ago
Of course I will
But sir here comes your servant
Dont worry about me
I told him that your father was in Venice and that you expected him to arrive in Padua today
He gives BIONDELLO  Here comes Baptista
Places everyone
Signior Baptista Im glad to see youSir this is the gentleman I told you of
I hope youll be a good father to me now
Give me Bianca for my inheritance
Sir pardon me for what I am about to say
I appreciate your frankness and your brevity
Its true that your son Lucentio here loves my daughter and she loves himor else theyre putting on quite an act
Your son will have my consent to marry my daughter
Not in my house Lucentio
My servants might overhear and old Gremio is still hanging around so we might be interrupted
I hope with all my heart she will
Cambio
What is it Biondello
You saw my master wink and laugh at you
What about it
Please educate me
Hes talking with the bogus father about the bogus son
And so
You are to bring his daughter to the supper
And then
The old priest at Saint Lukes Church is at your command at all hours
And what of all this
I dont know except they are busy with some phony guarantee
So go and put your stamp on the girl
Go to the church take the priest the clerk and some reasonably honest witnesses
If this isnt what youve been hoping for I have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to Bianca forever
I knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit
Farewell sir
My master has instructed me to go to Saint Lukes to tell the priest to be ready in case you should show up with your better half
She will be pleased
Then why am I worried
It will be hard if Cambio loses her
Come lets continue on toward your fathers house
Good Lord how bright and splendid is the moon tonight
The moon
You mean the sun
It is not nighttime now
I say its the moon that shines so bright
I know its the sun that shines so bright
Now by my mothers son and thats me it will be moon or star or whatever I want before Ill travel to your fathers house
I say its the moon
I know its the moon
Well youre a liar then
Its the blessed sun
Then God be praised it  Petruchio do whatever you like
Youve won
Well onward then
Thats how things should bestraight and smooth
But hang on
I hear someone coming
Young budding virgin fair and pure and sweet where are you off to
Your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child
Is  Would your Mightiness care to wash his hands
Were overjoyed to see you sane again
If only you had a clearer memory of who you are
These past fifteen years you have been living in a dream and even when you were awake it was as though you slept
Fifteen years
Thats some nap
But I never spoke the whole time
Oh yes you spoke my lord but total nonsense
But sir there is no such house no such maid and no such men as you have dreamed up like a certain Stephen Sly and one old John Naps of Greece a Peter Turph one Henry Pimpernell and twenty more men of this sortwho never actually existed
Why dear me Kate
I hope you havent lost your mind
This is not a maiden as you say but an old manwrinkled faded and withered
Well sir and you witty lady who gave me quite a turn with your strange talk my name is Vincentio my hometown Pisa and I am traveling to Padua to visit a son of mine whom I havent seen in a long while
What is his name
Lucentio sir
A fortunate coincidencemore fortunate for your son
The sister of my wife this lady here is married to your son
And theres no need for wonder or worry
Let me embrace the father of Lucentio and then well journey on to see your son who will rejoice at your arrival
I assure you sir its true
Well Petruchio all this is very encouraging
The priest is already there
Were off Biondello
Ill see them safely married first and then hurry back to my masters
I wonder why Cambio hasnt shown up in all this time
Here is the door sir
This is Lucentios house
My fatherinlaw lives closer to the marketplace
Thats where Im going now so Ill leave you here
You must not go without having a drink first
Theyre pretty busy in there
Youd better knock louder
Is Signior Lucentio at home sir
What if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to toss around          
I believe I have some choice in the matter sir
Come here you wretch
What have you forgotten me
Forgotten you
No sir
I could not forget you since I never saw you before in my life
My honorable reverend master
Yes of course
There he is at the window
Is that so
Help help help
This madman will murder me
How dare I
How dare    What is the man crazy
Your father
Why you scoundrel
Your father is a sailmaker in Bergamo
Youre wrong sir very wrong
Why what do you imagine his name to be
His name
Lucentio
Oh God hes murdered his master
Oh my son my son
Tell me you monster where is my son Lucentio
Take this mad wretch to jailFatherinlaw Baptista will you see that hes available to appear in court
Take me off to jail
He mustnt go to prison
Be quiet Signior Gremio
I say he shall go to prison
Be careful Signior Baptista lest you be made the dupe in this business
I could swear this is the real Vincentio  
Well no not literally
No I know that youre Signior Lucentio
Away with the doddering fool
Take him off to jail
Were ruined
There he is
Pardon dear father
Dear son youre alive
Pardon us dear father
What have you done
Where is Lucentio
I have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes
Weve all been duped
Where is that damned wretch Tranio who defied me in such a disgraceful manner
Say isnt this the Latin master Cambio
Cambio is transformed into Lucentio
It was love that performed these miracles
Biancas love made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around town
What Tranio did he did at my command
So pardon him dear father for my sake
No Ill slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail
But sir have you married my daughter without my consent
Dont worry Baptista youll be perfectly satisfied
Youll see
All I can hope for now is a share of the feast
Lets follow them to see how this turns out
First kiss me Kate and then we will
What here in the middle of the street
Are you ashamed of me
But Im ashamed to kiss sir
All right then back home we go
No wait
I  Isnt this good
Come my sweet Kate
Better late than neverand its never too late to change
Well thank God Im cured
Amen
I thank you all
You wont regret this
How is my noble lord
This is all quite pleasant
Where is my wife
Here noble lord
What is your wish with regard to her
You call yourself my wife yet you dont call me husband
Its my men who should call me lord Im your man your fellow
My fair Bianca bid my father welcome while I with equal affection welcome yours
This last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting
Now everyone be seated as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat
All we do is sit and sit and eat and eat
I wish that were true for both our sakes
Hortensio 
Thats very sensible but you missed my sense I meant Hortensio is afraid of you
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning
A very candid reply
Whats that supposed to mean
Thats what I conceive of him
Nice save
Kiss him for that good widow
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinningplease tell me what you meant by that
Your husband being saddled with a shrew projects his own suffering onto my husband
And now you know my meaning
A very nasty meaning
My meaning  And I 
You tell her widow
Ill bet you a hundred marks my Kate puts her flat on her back
Well thats really my job
Well said
Heres to you
What do you think of these quickwitted folks Gremio
They certainly do like to butt heads
Yes but not out of fear
Ill go back to sleep now
No you shall not
Ill 
Well she got away
Signior Tranio you also took aim at that bird though you didnt hit herSo heres a health to all whove shot and missed
A witty if a cynical reply
Its good you hunted for yourself sir
Tranio got you that time
I thank you for that quip good Tranio
Hes made me a little sore Ill admit
But since the gibe glanced off me ten to one it hit you both straight on
Seriously though son Petruchio I think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all
Well I disagree
Agreed
Whats the bet
Twenty crowns
Twenty crowns
Id wager twenty times as much on my wife
A hundred then
Agreed
Good
Its a bet
Who should begin
I will
Biondello go and tell your mistress to come to me
Here I go
Son Ill stake you half that Bianca comes
Ill have no halves
What
Shes busy and cannot come Is that an answer
Yes and a nice one at that
Pray God your wife doesnt send you a worse one
Im hoping for better
So wheres my wife
She says she thinks this is a prank
She will not come
She says that you should come to her
Worse and worse
She  I can guess her answer
What
She will not
By all thats holy here comes Katherina
You sent for me sir
Where are your sister and Hortensios wife
They sit chatting by the parlor fire
Go bring them here
If they refuse to come get physicaluse a whip if you have to but get them out here to their husbands
This is a miracle if you talk of miracles
It is
I wonder what it means
It means peace and love and a quiet life supremacy based on reverence and profound respect andnot to go on and on about iteverything thats sweet and happy
May good fortune come to you good Petruchio
Youve won the wager and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you
Look here she comes with your ungovernable wives in tow like prisoners of her womanly persuasionKatherine that cap of yours doesnt look good on you
Take it off and throw it on the ground
Lord may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that
For shame
What kind of loyalty is this
I wish your loyalty were as foolish
The wisdom of your loyalty fair Bianca has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner
The more fool you for betting on my loyalty
There will be no lecture
She shall not
I say she shallAnd first begin with her
Girls girls
This disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord your king your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land
A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king
And when she is peevish and perverse sullen sour and disobedient to his honest wishes what is she but a loathsome warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord
I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace that they seek authority supremacy and power when they are under an obligation to serve love and obey
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth unfit for toil and trouble in the world if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts
Come come you weak ungovernable worms
My spirit has been as proud as each of yours my courage as great and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown
But now I see our weapons are like straws our strength like a straws weakness and our weakness past comparison so that we seem to be the thing we most are not
Come on and kiss me Kate
Its nice to see children playing well together
But not so nice when women misbehave
Come Kate lets go to bed
We three are married but you two are defeated
Its amazing if I may say so that she let herself be tamed
Madam wife they say Ive been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years
Yes and it seemed twice as long to me having been kept from your bed that whole time
Thats too longServants leave her and me alone
Now madam undress and come to bed
Thrice noble lord I beg you to excuse me for another night or twoor at least until nightfall
Your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you as theres a risk that you might have a relapse
I hope this explanation will stand as my excuse
Im not sure I can wait that long
Still Id hate to see my former dreams return
So I  Your Honors actors hearing of your recovery have come to perform a pleasing comedy for youand your doctors approve wholeheartedly
So they think its a good idea for you to watch a play and direct your thoughts toward laughter and merrimenttwo strong preventive medicines that foster long life
Okay bring on the play
What like stuff from a house
No its a story
Well lets watch it
Were not getting any younger
I was born in Pisa famous for its serious citizens like my father before me my father Vincentio a successful worldtraveled merchant was one of the 
Ill fix you I swear
You thug
Read your history
We You wont pay for the glasses you smashed
No not a penny
Get out of my face
Go play with yourself
I know my rights
Im not moving an inch pal
Let them comeI dont care
Thats good advice
Wait
Who are all these people
Maybe its a parade to welcome us to town master
Dont worry I couldnt care less
The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool paint your face with blood and make a fool out of you
May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her
Me too Lord    
What a spoiled little brat
Sister be happy in my unhappinessSir I will humbly obey you
Ill take comfort in my books and music reading and practicing my instruments
Listen Tranio
Thats  Signior Baptista will you really be this cruel
Why are you locking her away because of this fiend from hell Signor Baptista
And because I know how fond she is of music playing her instruments and poetry I plan to hire livein tutors for her
Katherina you may stay
I dont think so
Am I to be dictated to like a child
You can go straight to hell
So long
That is if we ever want to return to being rivals for Biancas love
And that would be
To find a husband for her sister
A husband
You mean a devil
I mean a husband
I say a devil
Do you really think theres a man fool enough to marry into hellhowever rich the father is
Oh I dont know
Guys whod take her with all her faults provided there were enough money involved
I dont know
What do you say Signior Gremio
This imaginary suitor for KatherinaId buy him the best horse in Padua if hed get here quickly woo her marry her take her to bed and rid the house of her
Lets go
Sir is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly
Oh Tranio until it happened to me I never would have thought it possible
The heart wont be reasoned with
If love has touched you love has touched youend of story
Yes youre right
Please go on
I feel better already and I know theres more good advice where that came from
Master you were so focused on the girl herself I wonder if you missed the main point here
Oh no
Tranio I saw her coralpink lips move and perfume the air with her breath
Oh Tranio what a cruel father he is
Still did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her
I didand now Ive got it
Tranio I think Ive got it
Ill bet were both thinking the same thing master
Tell me your idea first
You will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl
It is
Do you think it would work
No not a chance
Enough
Its obvious  Here comes Biondello
Where have you been boy
Where have  Come here boy
Its no time for jokes sober up
Understand
Of course sir
And youre not to utter a syllable of Tranios name
Wish I could say the same
Id second your wish if it automatically meant that Lucentio could have Baptistas youngest daughter
This is for your masters sake not mine
When were by ourselves you can call me Tranio Everywhere else address me as your master Lucentio
Tranio lets go
One last thing and this is up to you
Youll have to woo Bianca like the rest
Dont ask why
No no
Very impressive
Is there any more or is that it
And what an excellent piece of work it is too madam lady
I wish it were over
Huntsman look after my hounds
Let Merriman catch his breaththe poor dogs foaming at the mouth
I think Belman is just as good my lord
I swear hes the better dog
Youre a fool
If Echo were as fast he would be worth a dozen like Belman
But give them all a good dinner and look after them well
Ill go hunting again tomorrow I think
I will my lord
Whats this
A drunkard or a corpse
Check and see if hes breathing
He is my lord
But this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadnt warmed himself with ale
Alas grim death how vile and ugly your neartwin sleep is
What do you think
Im off to visit my friends in Paduaparticularly my best friend Hortensio
And I think this is his house
Here you there Grumio
Knock
Knock sir
Whom should I knock
Has anyone offended your Worship
Moron
Im telling you to make a fist and pound
My master is being difficult
Say whats the trouble
If it isnt my old friend Grumioand my dear friend Petruchio
Hows everyone in Verona
Hortensio have you come to break up the fight
I dont care what he told you in Latin
I told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it
Knock at the gate
Oh for Petes sake
Didnt you clearly say Knock pound and put your fists to work
Now you say it was Knock at the gate
Im warning you
Easy Petruchio
Ill vouch for Grumio
Now my dear friend what lucky wind blows you in from Verona
The wind that scatters young men throughout the world encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home where theres little to be found in the way of experience
I have money in my purse and property at home so Im off to see the world
I doubt youd thank me in the end but shes rich all right very rich
But youre too good a friend for me to wish her on you
Hortensio good friends like us can get by on a few words
I can help you find a wife whos rich young beautiful and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman
Her only flawand its a big oneis that shes unbearable a total witch so much so that I wouldnt think of marrying her myself not even if I were in a worse fix than I am not for a whole goldmine
Hush Hortensio
You dont know what money can buy
Her father is Baptista Minola a pleasant and courteous gentleman
Her name is Katherina Minola famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue
I dont know her but I know her father and he knew mine well
I wont sleep until I see her Hortensio
Wait Petruchio I should go with you
His youngest daughter the beautiful Bianca is the jewel of my life and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand
Katherine the shrew Thats the worst thing you can call a young woman
Now my friend Petruchio will help me out presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca wellversed in music
Ill disguise myself in somber robes
Oh  Master master look
Who are these people
Hush Grumio
It is my rival for Bianca
Petruchio lets stand over here awhile
Oh what an excellent thing this learning is
Good to see you Signior Hortensio
Do you know where Im going
To Baptista Minolas house
Thats great
And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love
Gremio this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca
Thats good if hell really do it
Have you told him all her faults Hortensio
I know she is a hateful brawling scold
If thats all gentlemen I see no problem
No
Tell me friend
Where are you from
My fathers dead and his fortune is mine now
I hope to see good daysand many of them
Sir such a life with such a wife is unlikely
But if you have the stomach for it youll have all the help from me you need
Do you really mean to go after this wildcat
Why did I come here if not for that
I who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals
I who have heard the rumble of guns in battleand thunder in the sky heavens version of artillery
Listen Hortensio
Absolutelyso long as he gets the girl
I wish I could be as certain of a good dinner
Is that the man you want
But not the woman who scolds anyway I hope
Sir a word before you go
Are you a suitor to the girl we speak of yes or no
What if I am
Not if you go away there isnt
Because if you must know shes been chosen by Signior Gremio
Because shes been chosen by Signior Hortensio
Wait a minute gentlemen
Be good enough to hear me out
Baptista is a noble gentlemanone to whom my father is not completely unknownand lovely as his daughter is she is entitled to any number of suitorsmyself among them
I dont think hed have any choice my lord
When he woke he wouldnt know where he was
It would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy
Well take him on up and well try to pull it off
Carry him to my best roomgently so he doesnt wakeand hang all my erotic paintings around him
Bathe his filthy head with warm scented water
Convince him that he has been out of his mindand when he says hes out of his mind  My lord I promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him
The beautiful Helen of Troy had a thousand suitors
This fellow will outtalk us all
Hortensio whats all this about
Yes leave that labor to great Herculesits worse than the previous twelve put together  
Sir thats well said and well thought out
An excellent motion
Lets go
I second that 
Dear sister its unfair to meand unfair to yourselfto turn me into a slave
That I wont stand for
And dont lie
You lying brat
Its Hortensio isnt it
Oh I see
Youll live in luxury with Gremio
Is it because of 
What in my presence
You mean you dont even want to hear my side
Dont talk to me
Now what
Good morning neighbor Baptista
Good morning neighbor Gremio
And to you good sir
Tell me dont you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named Katherina
I have a daughter named Katherina sir
Please Signior Gremio
Allow me to continueI am a gentleman of Verona sir who hearing of your daughters beauty and wit her friendly disposition and bashful modesty her uncommon virtues and her mild behavior have taken the liberty of presenting myself as a guest at your house in the hope of seeing for myself if what Ive heard is true
You and he are both welcome sir
As for my daughter Katherine this much I know shes not for youmores the pity
I see you dont intend to part with heror perhaps you dont like my company
Dont misunderstand me sir
Im just stating the facts as I see them
Where are you from
Whats your name
My name is Petruchio son of Antonio a man well known throughout Italy
I know him well
You are welcome for his sake
Youre  Forgive me Signior Gremio but Im anxious to get things moving
No doubt but you may be going about it the wrong wayNeighbor this gift is very gracious Im sure
I myself who am more indebted to you than anyone have brought you this young scholar 
Many thanks Signior Gremio
Welcome good Cambio
Your name is Lucentio you say
Of what city may I ask
A man of great influence
I know him well by reputation
You are very welcome here sir 
Lets take a little walk in the orchard before dinner
You are all most welcome here please make yourselves at home
Signior Baptista Im actually in a bit of a hurry
You knew my father well therefore you know me the sole heir to all his property and possessions which I have added to rather than depleted
So tell me assuming I win your daughters love what dowry would she bring to the marriage
Twenty thousand crowns now and half my lands after my death
Lets have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises
That counts for everything
Oh thats nothing believe me sir
Im as commanding as she is proud and when two raging fires meet they end up consuming the very thing that kindled them
Im that great gust to her fire
Well good luck
But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness
Mountains dont tremble however much the wind may blow
Why so pale my friend
Will my daughter be a good musician do you think
I think shell be a better soldier
You dont think you can teach her
Ill give you frets With that she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through
I like this girl
Now I want her more than ever
I cant wait to meet her
Please do
Ill wait for her here and when she comes Ill take a novel approach with her
If she rants Ill tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale
If she glares Ill say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew
If she is silent and wont speak at all Ill praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence
If she orders me to go Ill thank her warmly as if shed just offered to put me up for a week
If she refuses my proposal Ill tell her how much Im looking forward to the announcement and the wedding
Carry him gently to bed and every man be ready at his post when he awakes
Go lad and find out what the trumpets sounding for
Its probably some noble gentleman stopping off in midjourney thinking to spend the night here
Sir its a troupe of actors who want to perform for your Lordship
Have them come in
You are welcome here my friends
We thank your Honor
Were you thinking of spending the night here
Yes if that would be all right with your Lordship
By all means
I remember this fellowhe once played the eldest son of a farmer
It was the play in which you wooed the gentlewoman so successfully
I have forgotten your name but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly
Good morning Kate for I hear thats what youre called
Is that what youve heard
Driven Really
I had you figured for a piece of furniture
What do you mean by furniture
A nice stool
Youre right actually
Come sit on me
Asses are made for bearing and so are you
Women are made for 
Not by the likes of you
I know how  Too light for a lout like you to catchthough no lighter than I should be
Should be
If Im a wasp look out for my stinger
All I have to do is remove it
True if a fool such as yourself could find it
Everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger
In its tail
No in its tongue
Whose tongue
Yours if were talking about  Im leaving
Youre leaving with my tongue in your tail
No come back Kate
Well see about that
I swear Ill smack you if you hit me again
Not if you want to keep your arms
It has no fighting spirit
Oh come on now Kate
Dont look so sour
Thats my way when I see a crabapple
Theres no crabapple here so dont look sour
There is a crabapple here
Show me
I would if I had a mirror
What you mean my face looks like a crabapple
You know youre right
I probably am too young for you
Maybe but youre wrinkled all the same
Oh thats with worry
Well that doesnt worry me
Let me go
No not a bit
I find you quite gentle
I was told that you were violent proud and sullen
You havent got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do
No you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation quiet and pleasant
Why does the world report that Kate is lame
The worlds a liar
Kate is as straight and slender as a hazeltwig her hair as brown as hazelnut shells and she herself sweeter than the kernels
Take a few stepsI want to see you walk
Did Diana ever beautify a grove as much as Kate beautifies this room with her queenly movements
Its born of my  A witty mother
Too bad about the son
Am I not wise
Im the man who was born to tame you and change you from a wildcat Kate into a Kate as gentle and domestic as other household Kates
I almost recognize that voice
ItsBut hes drowned and these guys are devils
Oh God help me
Four legs and two voicesa very special monster
One voice speaks well and talks about his friend
The other voice is harsh and abusive
If it takes all the wine in my bottle Ill cure him
Come on
CALIBAN  Stephano
Is your other mouth calling my name
Mercy mercy
This isnt a monster its a devil
Ill leave him alone
I have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil
Stephano
If youre Stephano touch me and speak to me
Im Trinculodont be scaredyour good friend Trinculo
If youre Trinculo then come out
Ill pull on these smaller legs
If any legs here are Trinculos these are 
But arent you drowned Stephano
I hope youre not drowned
Has the storm passed
I hid under this monsters cloak to get out of the storm
Are you really alive Stephano
Oh Stephano two men from Naples survived
Please stop turning me around
My stomachs a little upset
I swam ashore like a duck
I can swim like a duck I swear
Here 
Oh Stephano do you have any more of that wine
Ive got the whole barrel man
You come from heaven dont you
No from the moon Im telling you
I used to be the man in the moon a long time ago
My mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush
I cant believe I was scared of him
A pretty pathetic monster
The man in the moon
What a poor gullible monsterThat was a nice big gulp monster
What a lying drunken monster
When his god falls asleep the monster will snatch his wine bottle
Come on then
Get down and swear it
Im going to laugh myself to death over this silly monster
A rotten foolish monster
I could find it in my heart to beat him Come on kiss my feet
An awful monster
Ill show you where to get fresh water
Ill pick berries for you
Ill fish for you and get you plenty of firewood
The tyrant Im serving now can go to hell
What a silly monster to think a poor drunk is wonderful
Show us the way without further delayTrinculo since the king and all our comrades are drowned were the heirs of this placeHere carry my wine bottleTrinculo my buddy well get that bottle refilled soon enough
A loudmouthed drunken monster
Good monster
Show us the way
Right now Id give a thousand 
Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons
And you can do poor things that lead to rich results
This hard work would be boring and nasty to me but Im working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor
Oh shes ten times nicer than her father is mean and hes the height of crabbiness
I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up on strict orders from him
My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before
These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me especially when Im slaving away busily
Now please I beg you dont work so hard
I wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that youve been ordered to stack
Please put that log down and rest a while
When this wood burns itll weep for making you tired
My fathers studying hard so he wont see you
So please rest
Were safe from my father for at least three hours
Oh my dear mistress I wont be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest
If you sit down Ill carry your logs a while
Please give me that
Ill take it over to the pile
Id be as right for the job as you are and Id do it more easily since Id have good will on my side
You look tired
I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers
MirandaOh father Ive disobeyed you by telling him that
Ive looked at many ladies with pleasure and been
But with you its different
Youre perfect without a rival in the world made up of the best qualities of every creature
Ive never known any woman or seen a womans faceexcept my own in the mirror
And Ive never met any men besides you and my father
Im a prince by birth Mirandamaybe even a king now though I wish I werentand normally I wouldnt put up with carrying these logs any more than Id let flies breed in my mouth
But Ill tell you something from my soul
The second I saw you my heart rushed to serve you and be your slave so here I am now a patient logman
Do you love me
Oh heaven oh earth witness what Im about to say and reward me if I tell the truth
If Im lying then
More than anything else in the world I love you value you and honor you
Look at me cryingwhat a fool I am to cry at what makes me happy
Why are you crying
Im crying at how unworthy I am to give you what I want to give you and to take what Im dying to have
The more I try to hide what Im feeling the bigger it gets
Ill be your wife if youll have me
Otherwise Ill die a virgin devoted to you
You can refuse to make me your spouse but Ill be your servant whether you want me to or not
Youll be my wife dearest and Ill serve you forever
Will you be my husband then
A million goodbyes to you
Now its time to get back to my studying since I have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner
Dont tell me that
When the barrels empty well drink water
Not one drop sooner
Therefore drink upServantmonster drink a toast to me
Servant monster
What a crazy island this is
They say there are only five people on it
Were three of them
If the other two are as loopy as we are our countrys in bad shape
Drink when I order you servantmonster
Your eyes look like theyve sunk into your head
Where else should his eyes be if not in his head
Hed be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail
My manmonster is so drunk he cant talk
Hes not standing straight enough to hold a flag
Were not going to run in our army Monsieur Monster
Or walk either
Youll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing
Monster sweetie be a good monster and just speak once
How is your Highness
Let me lick your shoe
Lord he calls you
What an idiot that monster is
Trinculo speak politely
If you mutiny against me Ill hang you from the next tree
Thank you my noble lord
Now would you please listen once again to the request I made to you earlier
Ill stand and so will Trinculo
You lie
Trinculo if you interrupt him any more I swear Ill knock some teeth out of your head
I didnt say anything
Okay just stay quiet
Go on
I was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island
He stole it from me
If your highness is willing take revenge on him for thatbecause I know youre brave enough I dont dare to Thats for sure
Youll be lord of the island then and Ill be your servant
And how would we go about doing that
Can you bring me to him
Yes yes my lord
Ill take you to where he sleeps and you can pound a nail into his head
You lie
You cant do that
