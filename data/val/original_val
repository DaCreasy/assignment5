O Friar the damnèd use that word in hell
Howling attends it
How hast thou the heart Being a divine a ghostly confessor A sinabsolver and my friend professed To mangle me with that word banishèd
Thou fond mad man hear me a little speak
Here were the servants of your adversary And yours close fighting ere I did approach
I drew to part them
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows Came more and more and fought on part and part Till the Prince came who parted either part
Oh where is Romeo
Saw you him today
Right glad I am he was not at this fray
Towards him I made but he was ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood
Many a morning hath he there been seen With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
But all so soon as the allcheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Auroras bed Away from light steals home my heavy son
Oh thou wilt speak again of banishment
Talk no more
Oh then I see that madmen have no ears
How should they when that wise men have no eyes
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
Wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love An hour but married Tybalt murderèd Doting like me and like me banishèd Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground as I do now Taking the measure of an unmade grave
Arise
One knocks
Good Romeo hide thyself
Not I unless the breath of heartsick groans Mistlike infold me from the search of eyes
Who knocks so hard
Whence come you
Whats your will
O holy Friar O tell me holy Friar Where is my ladys lord
Wheres Romeo
Oh he is even in my mistress case Just in her case
O woeful sympathy Piteous predicament
Even so lies she Blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
Stand an you be a man
For Juliets sake for her sake rise and stand
Why should you fall into so deep an O
Nurse
Ah sir ah sir
Deaths the end of all
Spakest thou of Juliet
How is it with her
Where is she
And how doth she
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love
As if that name Shot from the deadly level of a gun Did murder her as that names cursed hand Murdered her kinsman
O tell me Friar tell me In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge
Tell me that I may sack The hateful mansion 
Art thou a man
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast
Thou hast amazed me
By my holy order I thought thy disposition better tempered
Hast thou slain Tybalt
Why railst thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
Fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit Which like a usurer aboundst in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
What rouse thee man
Thy Juliet is alive For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead There art thou happy
Tybalt would kill thee But thou slewst Tybaltthere art thou happy
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exilethere art thou happy
A pack of blessings light upon thy back Happiness courts thee in her best array
But like a misbehaved and sullen wench Thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love
Go get thee to thy love as was decreed
Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
Commend me to thy lady And bid her hasten all the house to bed Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
Romeo is coming
O Lord I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel
Oh what learning is
Do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
Here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
Hie you make haste for it grows very late
How well my comfort is revived by this
Go hence
Good night
And here stands all your state Either be gone before the watch be set Or by the break of day disguised from hence
Sojourn in Mantua
Ill find out your man And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here
Give me thy hand
Tis late
Farewell
Things have falln out sir so unluckily That we have had no time to move our daughter
Look you she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly And so did I
Well we were born to die
These times of woe afford no time to woo
Madam good night
Commend me to your daughter
I will and know her mind early tomorrow
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness
Sir Paris I will make a desperate tender Of my childs love
Acquaint her here of my son Paris love And bid her mark you me on Wednesday next But soft
What day is this
Monday my lord
Monday
Ha ha
Do you like this haste
Well keep no great ado a friend or two
For hark you Tybalt being slain so late It may be thought we held him carelessly Being our kinsman if we revel much
Therefore well have some half a dozen friends And there an end
But what say you to Thursday
My lord I would that Thursday were tomorrow
Well get you gone
O Thursday be it then Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed
Wilt thou be gone
It is not yet near day
It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
Look love what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
Nights candles are burnt out and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
Yon light is not daylight I know it I
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer And light thee on thy way to Mantua
Therefore stay yet
Thou needst not to be gone
Let me be taen
Let me be put to death
I am content so thou wilt have it so
I have more care to stay than will to go
Come death and welcome
Lets talk
It is not day
It is it is
It is the lark that sings so out of tune Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
Some say the lark makes sweet division
This doth not so for she divideth us
More light and light it grows
More light and light more dark and dark our woes
Madam
Nurse
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber
The day is broke
Then window let day in and let life out
Farewell farewell
One kiss and Ill descend
And private in his chamber pens himself Shuts up his windows locks fair daylight out And makes himself an artificial night
My noble uncle do you know the cause
I neither know it nor can learn of him
Have you importuned him by any means
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shriftCome madam lets away
Art thou gone so love lord
Oh by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo
Farewell
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings love to thee
Oh thinkst thou we shall ever meet again
O God I have an illdivining soul
Methinks I see thee now thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb
Either my eyesight fails or thou lookst pale
And trust me love in my eye so do you
Dry sorrow drinks our blood
Adieu adieu
O fortune fortune
All men call thee fickle
Be fickle fortune For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back  
Who is t that calls
Is it my lady mother
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither
Why how now Juliet
Madam I am not well
Evermore weeping for your cousins death
What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
An if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
Therefore have done
Some grief shows much of love But much of grief shows still some want of wit
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
So shall you feel the loss but not the friend Which you weep for
Feeling so the loss Cannot choose but ever weep the friend
Well girl thou weepst not so much for his death As that the villain lives which slaughtered him
What villain madam
That same villain Romeo
That is because the traitor murderer lives
Ay madam from the reach of these my hands
Would none but I might venge my cousins death
Then weep no more
Ill send to one in Mantua Where that same banished runagate doth live Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied
Indeed I never shall be satisfied With Romeo till I behold himdead Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed
Madam if you could find out but a man To bear a poison I would temper it That Romeo should upon receipt thereof Soon sleep in quiet
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him
Find thou the means and Ill find such a man
But now Ill tell thee joyful tidings girl
And joy comes well in such a needy time
What are they beseech your ladyship
Well well thou hast a careful father child
Madam in happy time what day is that
Marry my child early next Thursday morn The gallant young and noble gentleman The County Paris at Saint Peters Church Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
Now by Saint Peters Church and Peter too He shall not make me there a joyful bride
I wonder at this haste that I must wed Ere he that should be husband comes to woo
I pray you tell my lord and father madam I will not marry yet
And when I do I swear It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate Rather than Paris
These are news indeed
Here comes your father
Tell him so yourself And see how he will take it at your hands
How now
A conduit girl
What still in tears Evermore showering
Have you delivered to her our decree
I would the fool were married to her grave
How will she none
Is she not proud
Doth she not count her blessed Unworthy as she is that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride
Not proud you have but thankful that you have
How how how how
Chopped logic
What is this
Proud and I thank you and I thank you not And yet not proud
Out you green sickness carrion
Out you baggage
You tallow face
Fie fie
What are you mad
Good Father I beseech you on my knees Hear me with patience but to speak a word
Speak not
Reply not
Do not answer me
Out on her hilding
God in heaven bless her
You are to blame my lord to rate her so
And why my Lady Wisdom
Smatter with your gossips go
I speak no treason
Oh God i good een
May not one speak
Peace you mumbling fool
Utter your gravity oer a gossips bowl For here we need it not
You are too hot
Gods bread
It makes me mad
Day night hour tide time work play Alone in company still my care hath been To have her matched
Thursday is near
Lay hand on heart advise
An you be mine Ill give you to my friend
Trust to t bethink you
Ill not be forsworn
Delay this marriage for a month a week
Or if you do not make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies
Talk not to me for Ill not speak a word
Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee
O GodO Nurse how shall this be prevented
My husband is on earth my faith in heaven
How shall that faith return again to earth Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth
Comfort me
Hast thou not a word of joy
Some comfort Nurse
Oh hes a lovely gentleman
Romeos a dishclout to him
An eagle madam Hath not so green so quick so fair an eye As Paris hath
Beshrew my very heart I think you are happy in this second match For it excels your first
Or if it did not Your first is dead or twere as good he were As living here and you no use of him
Speakest thou from thy heart
Amen
What
Well thou hast comforted me marvelous much
Go in and tell my lady I am gone Having displeased my father to Lawrences cell To make confession and to be absolved
Marry I will and this is wisely done
O most wicked fiend
Ill to the friar to know his remedy
If all else fail myself have power to die
On Thursday sir
The time is very short
You say you do not know the ladys mind
I like it not
Now do you know the reason of this haste
Look sir here comes the lady toward my cell
Happily met my lady and my wife
That may be sir when I may be a wife
Good morrow cousin
Is the day so young
But new struck nine
Was that my father that went hence so fast
It was
Not having that which having makes them short
In love
Out
Of love
Where shall we dineO me
That may be must be love on Thursday next
What must be shall be
Thats a certain text
Come you to make confession to this Father
To answer that I should confess to you
Do not deny to him that you love me
I will confess to you that I love him
So will ye I am sure that you love me
If I do so it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face
Poor soul thy face is much abused with tears
Thy face is mine and thou hast slandered it
My leisure serves me pensive daughter now My lord we must entreat the time alone
God shield I should disturb devotion Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye
O Juliet I already know thy grief
I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it On Thursday next be married to this county
Tell me not Friar that thou hearst of this Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise And with this knife Ill help it presently
Hold then
Wednesday is tomorrow
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
Give me give me
Love give me strength and strength shall help afford
Farewell dear Father
You shall have none ill sir for Ill try if they can lick their fingers
How canst thou try them so
Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me
Go be gone
We shall be much unfurnished for this time
Ay forsooth
See where she comes from shrift with merry look
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon
Send for the county
Go tell him of this
Ill have this knot knit up tomorrow morning
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence cell And gave him what becomèd love I might Not stepping oer the bounds of modesty
Why I am glad on t
This is well
Stand up
Ay marry go I say and fetch him hither Now afore God this reverend holy friar
Our whole city is much bound to him
Nurse will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow
No not till Thursday
There is time enough
Well to church tomorrow
Tis now near night
Tush I will stir about And all things shall be well I warrant thee wife
Go thou to Juliet help to deck up her

Ill play the housewife for this once
Ay those attires are best
What are you busy ho
Need you my help
For I am sure you have your hands full all In this so sudden business
Good night
FarewellGod knows when we shall meet again
My dismal scene I needs must act alone
Come vial
What if this mixture do not work at all
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning
Lie thou there
Oh look
Methinks I see my cousins ghost Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body Upon a rapiers point
Stay Tybalt stay
Romeo Romeo Romeo
Heres drink
I drink to thee
No coz I rather weep
Good heart at what
Why such is loves transgression
What is it else
A madness most discreet A choking gall and a preserving sweet
Farewell my coz
Soft
I will go along
And if you leave me so you do me wrong
Tut I have lost myself
I am not here
Tell me in sadness who is that you love
What shall I groan and tell thee
Groan
Why no
But sadly tell me who
Hold take these keys and fetch more spices Nurse
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry
Come stir stir stir
The second cock hath crowed
The curfew bell hath rung
Spare not for the cost
Go you cotquean go
Get you to bed faith
Youll be sick tomorrow For this nights watching
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause and neer been sick
Ay you have been a mousehunt in your time But I will watch you from such watching now
A jealous hood a jealous hood

Mass and well said

Madam
Sweetheart
Why bride
What not a word
You take your pennyworths now
How sound is she asleep
Ay let the county take you in your bed
Hell fright you up i faith
Will it not be
What noise is here
O lamentable day
What is the matter
Look look
O heavy day
O me O me
My child my only life Revive look up or I will die with thee Help help
For shame bring Juliet forth
Her lord is come
Shes dead deceased shes dead
Alack the day
Alack the day
Shes dead shes dead shes dead
Ha
Let me see her
Out alas
Shes cold
Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff
Life and these lips have long been separated
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field
O lamentable day
O woeful time
Death that hath taen her hence to make me wail Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak
Come is the bride ready to go to church
Ready to go but never to return
Death is my soninlaw
Death is my heir
My daughter he hath wedded
I will die And leave him all
Life living all is Deaths
Have I thought long to see this mornings face And doth it give me such a sight as this
Accursed unhappy wretched hateful day
Most miserable hour that eer time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage
But one poor one one poor and loving child But one thing to rejoice and solace in And cruel death hath catched it from my sight
O woe
O woeful woeful woeful day
Never was seen so black a day as this
O woeful day O woeful day
Beguiled divorcèd wrongèd spited slain
Most detestable Death by thee beguiled By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown
O love
O life
Not life but love in death
Despised distressèd hated martyred killed
Uncomfortable time why camest thou now To murder murder our solemnity
My soul and not my child
Dead art thou
Peace ho for shame
Confusions cure lives not In these confusions
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid
Now heaven hath all
And all the better is it for the maid
Your part in her you could not keep from death But heaven keeps his part in eternal life
The most you sought was her promotion For twas your heaven she should be advanced
And weep ye now seeing she is advanced Above the clouds as high as heaven itself
Oh in this love you love your child so ill That you run mad seeing that she is well
Shes not well married that lives married long But shes best married that dies married young
Our instruments to melancholy bells Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse And all things change them to the contrary
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill Move them no more by crossing their high will
Faith we may put up our pipes and be gone
Ay by my troth the case may be amended
Not a dump we
Tis no time to play now
You will not then
No
I will then give it you soundly
What will you give us
No money on my faith but the gleek
I will give you the minstrel
Then I will give you the serving creature
Then will I lay the serving creatures dagger on your pate
I will carry no crotchets
Then have at you with my wit
Answer me like men
Marry sir because silver hath a sweet sound
Prates tooWhat say you James Soundpost
Faith I know not what to say
I will say for you
It is music with her silver sound because musicians have no gold for sounding
What a pestilent knave is this same
Hang him Jack
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
Ah me
How sweet is love itself possessed When but loves shadows are so rich in joy
News from VeronaHow now Balthasar
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
How doth my lady
Is my father well
How fares my Juliet
That I ask again For nothing can be ill if she be well
Then she is well and nothing can be ill
Her body sleeps in Capels monument And her immortal part with angels lives
I saw her laid low in her kindreds vault And presently took post to tell it you
O pardon me for bringing these ill news Since you did leave it for my office sir
A sick man in sadness makes his will A word ill urged to one that is so ill
In sadness cousin I do love a woman
A right good markman
And shes fair I love
A right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
Well in that hit you miss
She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste For beauty starved with her severity Cuts beauty off from all posterity
She is too fair too wise wisely too fair To merit bliss by making me despair
Be ruled by me
Forget to think of her
O teach me how I should forget to think
Is it een so
Then I defy you stars
Thou knowst my lodging
Get me ink and paper And hire post horses
I will hence tonight
I do beseech you sir have patience
Your looks are pale and wild and do import Some misadventure
Tush thou art deceived
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar
No my good lord
No matter
Get thee gone And hire those horses
Ill be with thee straight
Well Juliet I will lie with thee tonight
Lets see for means
O mischief thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men
As I remember this should be the house
Being holiday the beggars shop is shut
What ho
Apothecary
Who calls so loud
Come hither man
I see that thou art poor
Hold there is forty ducats
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness And fearst to die
Famine is in thy cheeks
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
The world is not thy friend nor the worlds law
The world affords no law to make thee rich
Buy food and get thyself in flesh Come cordial and not poison go with me To Juliets grave for there must I use thee
Holy Franciscan Friar
Brother ho
This same should be the voice of Friar John
Welcome from Mantua
What says Romeo
Or if his mind be writ give me his letter
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed
Who bare my letter then to Romeo
Unhappy fortune
Brother Ill go and bring it thee
Now must I to the monument alone
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake
But I will write again to Mantua And keep her at my cell till Romeo come
Poor living corse closed in a dead mans tomb
Give me thy torch boy
Hence and stand aloof
Yet put it out for I would not be seen
Give me those flowers
Do as I bid thee go
Yet I will adventure
The boy gives warning something doth approach
What cursèd foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true loves rite
What with a torch
Muffle me night awhile
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
I will be gone sir and not trouble you
So shalt thou show me friendship
Take thou that
Good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
Fly hence and leave me
Think upon these gone
Let them affright thee
I beseech thee youth Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury
O be gone
Stay not be gone
Live and hereafter say A madmans mercy bid thee run away
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here
Wilt thou provoke me
Then have at thee boy
O Lord they fight
I will go call the watch
Open the tomb
Mercutios kinsman noble County Paris
What said my man when my betossèd soul Did not attend him as we rode
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet
Said he not so
Or did I dream it so
Ill bury thee in a triumphant grave
A grave
Oh no
A lantern slaughtered youth For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light
Death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
Thou art not conquered
O what more favor can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy
Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous And that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour
Here here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids
Oh here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this worldwearied flesh
Eyes look your last
Arms take your last embrace
Thy drugs are quick
Thus with a kiss I die
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair
Saint Francis be my speed
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at gravesWhos there
Heres one a friend and one that knows you well
Bliss be upon you
Tell me good my friend What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls
As I discern It burneth in the Capels monument
Who is it
Romeo
How long hath he been there
Full half an hour
Go with me to the vault
I dare not sir
Stay then
Ill go alone
Fear comes upon me
Oh much I fear some ill unthrifty thing
As I did sleep under this yew tree here I dreamt my master and another fought And that my master slew him
Romeo Alack alack what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher
O comfortable Friar
Where is my lord
I do remember well where I should be And there I am
Where is my Romeo
I hear some noise
Lady come from that nest Of death contagion and unnatural sleep
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents
Come come away
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead And Paris too
Come Ill dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns
A cup closed in my true loves hand
Poison I see hath been his timeless end O churl drunk all and left no friendly drop To help me after
I will kiss thy lips
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them To make me die with a restorative
Yea noise
Then Ill be brief
O happy dagger This is thy sheath
There rust and let me die
This is the place
There where the torch doth burn
The ground is bloodySearch about the churchyard
Pitiful sight
Here lies the county slain And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead Who here hath lain these two days buried Go tell the Prince
Run to the Capulets
Raise up the Montagues
Some others search
Heres Romeos man
We found him in the churchyard
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither
Here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyards side
A great suspicion
Stay the friar too
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad
Oh the people in the street cry Romeo Some Juliet and some Paris and all run With open outcry toward our monument
Search seek and know how this foul murder comes
O heavens
O wife look how our daughter bleeds
This dagger hath mistaenfor lo his house Is empty on the back of Montague And it missheathèd in my daughters bosom
O me
This sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulcher
Alas my liege my wife is dead tonight
Grief of my sons exile hath stopped her breath
What further woe conspires against mine age
Look and thou shalt see
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring their head their true descent And then will I be general of your woes And lead you even to death
Meantime forbear And let mischance be slave to patience Bring forth the parties of suspicion
I am the greatest able to do least Yet most suspected as the time and place Doth make against me of this direful murder
And here I stand both to impeach and purge Myself condemnèd and myself excused
Then say at once what thou dost know in this
I will be brief for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale
Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrowed grave Being the time the potions force should cease
What can he say in this
Their course of love the tidings of her death
Montague
O brother Montague give me thy hand
But now my lord what say you to my suit
But saying oer what I have said before
My child is yet a stranger in the world
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years
Younger than she are happy mothers made
And too soon marred are those so early made
But woo her gentle Paris get her heart
This night I hold an old accustomed feast Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of starcrossed lovers take their life Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents strife
The fearful passage of their deathmarked love And the continuance of their parents rage Which but their childrens end naught could remove Is now the two hours traffic of our stage The which if you with patient ears attend What here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When wellappareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house
Go sirrah trudge about Through fair Verona
Find them out whose names are written here
It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ
Take thou some new infection to thy eye And the rank poison of the old will die
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that
For what I pray thee
Why Romeo art thou mad
Not mad but bound more than a madman is Shut up in prison kept without my food Whipped and tormented andGood een good fellow
God i good een
I pray sir can you read
Ay mine own fortune in my misery
Perhaps you have learned it without book
But I pray can you read anything you see
Ay if I know the letters and the language
Ye say honestly
Stay fellow
I can read
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters County Anselme and his beauteous sisters The lady widow of Vitruvio Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces Mercutio and his brother Valentine Mine uncle Capulet his wife and daughters My fair niece Rosaline and Livia
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt Lucio and the lively Helena A fair assembly
Whither should they come
Up
Whither
To supper
To our house
Whose house
My masters
Indeed I should have asked thee that before
Now Ill tell you without asking
My master is the great rich Capulet and if you be not of the house of Montagues I pray come and crush a cup of wine
Rest you merry
At this same ancient feast of Capulets Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona
Go thither and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show And I will make thee think thy swan a crow
One fairer than my love
The allseeing sun Neer saw her match since first the world begun
Ill go along no such sight to be shown But to rejoice in splendor of mine own
Nurse wheres my daughter
Call her forth to me
Now by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come
What lamb
How now who calls
Your mother
Madam I am here
What is your will
Thou knowst my daughters of a pretty age
Faith I can tell her age unto an hour
Shes not fourteen
Ill lay fourteen of my teethand yet to my teen be it spoken I have but fourshe is not fourteen
Even or odd of all days in the year Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen
Susan and sheGod rest all Christian souls Were of an age
Well Susan is with God
She was too good for me
But as I said On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen
That shall she
Marry I remember it well
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years And she was weanedI never shall forget it Of all the days of the year upon that day
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall
My lord and you were then at Mantua Nay I do bear a brainBut as I said When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
Shake quoth the dovehouse
Twas no need I trow To bid me trudge
Yea quoth he Dost thou fall upon thy face
And pretty fool it stinted and said ay Enough of this
I pray thee hold thy peace
Yes madam
Yet I cannot choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say ay And yet I warrant it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerels stone A perilous knock and it cried bitterly
Yea quoth my husband Fallst upon thy face
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age
Wilt thou not Jule It stinted and said ay And stint thou too I pray thee Nurse say I
God mark thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that eer I nursed
An I might live to see thee married once I have my wish
Tell me daughter Juliet How stands your disposition to be married
It is an honor that I dream not of
Well think of marriage now
Younger than you Here in Verona ladies of esteem Are made already mothers
By my count I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid
Thus then in brief The valiant Paris seeks you for his love
A man young lady
Veronas summer hath not such a flower
What say you
Ill look to like if looking liking move
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly
I must hence to wait
I beseech you follow straight
We follow theeJuliet the county stays
Go girl seek happy nights to happy days
What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
Or shall we on without apology
The date is out of such prolixity
But let them measure us by what they will
Give me a torch
I am not for this ambling
Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance
Not I believe me
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move
You are a lover
Borrow Cupids wings And soar with them above a common bound
I am too sore enpiercèd with his shaft To soar with his light feathers and so bound I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
Under loves heavy burden do I sink
I mean an we be in choler well draw
I strike quickly being moved
But thou art not quickly moved to strike
To move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand
A dog of that house shall move me to stand
And to sink in it should you burthen love Too great oppression for a tender thing
Is love a tender thing
It is too rough Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
If love be rough with you be rough with love
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
Come we burn daylight ho
Nay thats not so
We waste our lights in vain like lights by day
And we mean well in going to this mask But tis no wit to go
Why may one ask
I dreamt a dream tonight
And so did I
Well what was yours
That dreamers often lie
In bed asleep while they do dream things true
Oh then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
Sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose And then dreams he of smelling out a suit
And sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail Tickling a parsons nose as he lies asleep Then he dreams of another benefice
This is she    Peace peace Mercutio peace
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
Supper is done and we shall come too late
On lusty gentlemen
Strike drum
Wheres Potpan that he helps not to take away
When good manners shall lie all in one or two mens hands and they unwashed too tis a foul thing
Away with the jointstools remove the courtcupboard look to the plate
Good thou save me a piece of marchpane and as thou loves me let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and NellAntony and Potpan
Ay boy ready
You are looked for and called for asked for and sought for in the great chamber
We cannot be here and there too
Cheerly boys
Be brisk 0awhile and the longer liver take all
Welcome gentlemen
She that makes dainty She Ill swear hath corns
Am I come near ye now Welcome gentlemen
Byr Lady thirty years
Tis more tis more
His son is elder sir
His son is thirty
Will you tell me that
His son was but a ward two years ago
I know not sir
Oh she doth teach the torches to burn bright
For I neer saw true beauty till this night
This by his voice should be a Montague   What dares the slave Come hither covered with an antic face To fleer and scorn at our solemnity
Wherefore storm you so
Uncle this is a Montague our foe A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night
Young Romeo is it
Tis he that villain Romeo
Content thee gentle coz
Let him alone
He bears him like a portly gentleman And to say truth Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and wellgoverned youth
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement
Therefore be patient
Take no note of him
Youll not endure him
Why uncle tis a shame
Go to go to
You are a saucy boy
Is t so indeed
This trick may chance to scathe you I know what
You must contrary me
Ill make you quietWhat cheerly my hearts
Have not saints lips and holy palmers too
Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
O then dear saint let lips do what hands do
They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
Saints do not move though grant for prayers sake
Then move not while my prayers effect I take
Thus from my lips by thine my sin is purged
Then have my lips the sin that they have took
Sin from thy lips
Give me my sin again
You kiss by th book
Madam your mother craves a word with you
What is her mother
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal
I tell you he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks
Nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards Is it een so
Ill to my rest
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men
Tis all one
I will show myself a tyrant
The heads of the maids
Ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads
Take it in what sense thou wilt
They must take it in sense that feel it
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand and tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh
Tis well thou art not fish
Draw thy tool
My naked weapon is out
Come hither Nurse
What is yond gentleman
The son and heir of old Tiberio
Whats he that now is going out of door
Marry that I think be young Petruchio
I know not
Go ask his nameIf he be married
Whats this
Whats this
The strangers all are gone
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again Alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks But to his foe supposed he must complain And she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks
And she as much in love her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere
But passion lends them power time means to meet Tempering extremities with extreme sweet
Can I go forward when my heart is here
He is wise And on my life hath stoln him home to bed
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall
Call good Mercutio
Nay Ill conjure too
Romeo
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied
Cry but Ay me Pronounce but love and dove Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word One nickname for her purblind son and heir Young Abraham Cupid he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
An if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
This cannot anger him
My invocation Is fair and honest
Blind is his love and best befits the dark
If love be blind love cannot hit the mark
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone O Romeo that she were
Go then for tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it
Cast it off
It is my lady
Oh it is my love
Oh that she knew she were
She speaks yet she says nothing
What of that
Her eye discourses
Tis not to me she speaks
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven Having some business do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
Oh that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek
O Romeo Romeo
Wherefore art thou Romeo
Tis but thy name that is my enemy
Henceforth I never will be Romeo
What man art thou that thus bescreened in night So stumblest on my counsel
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb And the place death considering who thou art If any of my kinsmen find thee here
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me
If they do see thee they will murder thee
Look thou but sweet And I am proof against their enmity
I would not for the world they saw thee here
My life were better ended by their hate Than death proroguèd wanting of thy love
Thou knowst the mask of night is on my face Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
Dost thou love me
I know thou wilt say ay And I will take thy word
What shall I swear by
Do not swear at all
Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self Which is the god of my idolatry And Ill believe thee
If my hearts dear love Well do not swear
Although I joy in thee I have no joy of this contract tonight
This bud of love by summers ripening breath May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight
Th exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it And yet I would it were to give again
Wouldst thou withdraw it
For what purpose love
But to be frank and give it thee again
And yet I wish but for the thing I have
My bounty is as boundless as the sea My love as deep
I hear some noise within
Dear love adieu Anon good NurseSweet Montague be true
Stay but a little
I will come again
O blessèd blessèd night
I am afeard Being in night all this is but a dream Too flattering sweet to be substantial
Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed
Fear me not
Let us take the law of our sides
Let them begin
I will frown as I pass by and let them take it as they list
Nay as they dare
I will bite my thumb at them which is a disgrace to them if they bear it
Do you bite your thumb at us sir
I do bite my thumb sir
Do you bite your thumb at us sir
Do you quarrel sir
Quarrel sir
No sir
Tomorrow will I send
So thrive my soul A thousand times good night
A thousand times the worse to want thy light
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine With repetition of My Romeo It is my soul that calls upon my name
How silversweet sound lovers tongues by night Like softest music to attending ears
Romeo
My nyas
What oclock tomorrow Shall I send to thee
By the hour of nine
I will not fail
Tis twenty year till then
I have forgot why I did call thee back
Let me stand here till thou remember it
And Ill still stay to have thee still forget Forgetting any other home but this
Tis almost morning
And yet no further than a wantons bird That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves And with a silken thread plucks it back again So lovingjealous of his liberty
I would I were thy bird
Sweet so would I
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing
Good night good night
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
Hence will I to my ghostly friars close cell His help to crave and my dear hap to tell
The grayeyed morn smiles on the frowning night Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth days path and Titans fiery wheels
Now ere the sun advance his burning eye The day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and preciousjuicèd flowers
The earth thats natures mother is her tomb
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find Many for many virtues excellent None but for some and yet all different
Oh mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs plants stones and their true qualities
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied And vice sometime by action dignified
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power
Two such opposèd kings encamp them still In man as well as herbsgrace and rude will
And where the worser is predominant Full soon the canker death eats up that plant
Good morrow Father
Benedicite
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me
Young son it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
Care keeps his watch in every old mans eye And where care lodges sleep will never lie
But where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature
Or if not so then here I hit it right Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight
That last is true
The sweeter rest was mine
With Rosaline my ghostly Father
Thats my good son
But where hast thou been then
Ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies
I bear no hatred blessèd man for lo My intercession likewise steads my foe
Here comes your father
Never make denial
I must and will have Katherine to my wife
Now Signior Petruchio how speed you with my daughter
How but well sir
Why how now daughter Katherine
In your dumps
Call you me daughter
Father tis thus yourself and all the world That talked of her have talked amiss of her
Ill see thee hanged on Sunday first
Hark Petruchio she says shell see thee hanged first
Is this your speeding
Nay then good night our part
Be patient gentlemen
I choose her for myself
If she and I be pleased whats that to you
Tis bargained twixt us twain being alone That she shall still be curst in company
I tell you tis incredible to believe How much she loves me
O the kindest Kate
O you are novices
Tis a world to see How tame when men and women are alone A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew Give me thy hand Kate
I will unto Venice To buy apparel gainst the wedding day
God send you joy Petruchio
Tis a match
Amen say we
We will be witnesses
Father and wife and gentlemen adieu
I will to Venice
Sunday comes apace
We will be married o Sunday
Was ever match clapped up so suddenly
Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas
The gain I seek is quiet in the match
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch
But now Baptista to your younger daughter
Now is the day we long have lookèd for
I am your neighbor and was suitor first
Youngling thou canst not love so dear as I   Graybeard thy love doth freeze
But thine doth fry
Skipper stand back
Tis age that nourisheth
Content you gentlemen
I will compound this strife
First as you know my house within the city Is richly furnishèd with plate and gold Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns In cypress chests my arras counterpoints Costly apparel tents and canopies Fine linen Turkey cushions bossed with pearl Valance of Venice gold in needlework Pewter and brass and all things that belong To house or housekeeping
Then at my farm I have a hundred milchkine to the pail Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls And all things answerable to this portion
Two thousand ducats by the year of land
Nay I have offered all I have no more And she can have no more than all I have
I must confess your offer is the best And let your father make her the assurance She is your own else you must pardon me
If you should die before him wheres her dower
And may not young men die as well as old
Well gentlemen I am thus resolved On Sunday next you know My daughter Katherina is to be married
I think twas Soto that your Honor means
Tis very true
Thou didst it excellent
There is a lord will hear you play tonight But I am doubtful of your modesties Lest overeyeing of his odd behavior For yet his Honor never heard a play You break into some merry passion And so offend him
Go sirrah take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one
Adieu good neighbor
Sirrah young gamester your father were a fool To give thee all and in his waning age Set foot under thy table
Tut a toy
An old Italian fox is not so kind my boy
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide
Fathers commonly Do get their children
But in this case of wooing A child shall get a sire if I fail not of my cunning
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned
Where left we last
Here madam     Conster them
Now let me see if I can conster it
I must believe my master else I promise you I should be arguing still upon that doubt
But let it restNow Litio to you
Good master take it not unkindly pray That I have been thus pleasant with you both
Call you this gamut
Tut I like it not
Old fashions please me best
Mistress your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sisters chamber up
You know tomorrow is the wedding day
Farewell sweet masters both
I must be gone
But I have cause to pry into this pedant
Methinks he looks as though he were in love
No shame but mine
Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say Lo there is mad Petruchios wife If it would please him come and marry her   Upon my life Petruchio means but well Whatever fortune stays him from his word Though he be blunt I know him passing wise Though he be merry yet withal hes honest
Would Katherine had never seen him though
Go girl
I cannot blame thee now to weep For such an injury would vex a very saint Much more a shrew of thy impatient humor
Master master
News old news and such news as you never heard of
Is it new and old too
How may that be
Why is it not news to hear of Petruchios coming
Is he come
Why no sir
What then
He is coming
When will he be here
When he stands where I am and sees you there  
Who comes with him
A monster a very monster in apparel and not like a Christian footboy or a gentlemans lackey
I am glad hes come howsoeer he comes
Why sir he comes not
Didst thou not say he comes
Who
That Petruchio came
Ay that Petruchio came
No sir I say his horse comes with him on his back
Why thats all one
Nay by Saint Jamy I hold you a penny A horse and a man Is more than one And yet not many
You are welcome sir
See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst Anon Ill give thee more instructions
I know the boy will well usurp the grace Voice gait and action of a gentlewoman
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant
Ill in to counsel them
Where is my love
Why sir you know this is your wedding day
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear
But where is Kate
I stay too long from her
See not your bride in these unreverent robes
Go to my chamber put on clothes of mine
Not I believe me
Thus Ill visit her
But thus I trust you will not marry her
Good sooth even thus
Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements Twere well for Kate and better for myself
But what a fool am I to chat with you When I should bid good morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss
He hath some meaning in his mad attire
We will persuade him be it possible To put on better ere he go to church
Ill after him and see the event of this
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent
Well overreach the graybeard Gremio The narrowprying father Minola The quaint musician amorous Litio All for my masters sake Lucentio
Signior Gremio came you from the church
As willingly as eer I came from school
A bridegroom say you
Why hes a devil a devil a very fiend  
Tut shes a lamb a dove a fool to him
Now take them up quoth he if any list   Trembled and shook for why he stamped and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him
But after many ceremonies done He calls for wine
This done he took the bride about the neck And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo
Such a mad marriage never was before
Hark hark
I hear the minstrels play
Is t possible you will away tonight
Make it no wonder
If you knew my business You would entreat me rather go than stay
And honest company I thank you all That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient sweet and virtuous wife
Let me entreat you
It cannot be
Let me entreat you
I am content
Are you content to stay
I am content you shall entreat me stay But yet not stay entreat me how you can
Now if you love me stay
Grumio my horse
Ay sir they be ready
The oats have eaten the horses
The door is open sir
There lies your way
For me Ill not be gone till I please myself
O Kate content thee
Prithee be not angry
I will be angry
What hast thou to do Father be quiet
He shall stay my leisure
Ay marry sir now it begins to work
Gentlemen forward to the bridal dinner
I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist
Ill buckler thee against a million
Nay let them go a couple of quiet ones
Went they not quickly I should die with laughing
That being mad herself shes madly mated
Neighbors and friends though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table You know there wants no junkets at the feast
She shall Lucentio
Come gentlemen lets go
Fie fie on all tired jades on all mad masters and all foul ways
Was ever man so beaten
Was ever man so rayed
Was ever man so weary
I am sent before to make a fire and they are coming after to warm them
Now were not I a little pot and soon hot my very lips might freeze to my teeth my tongue to the roof of my mouth my heart in my belly ere I should come by a fire to thaw me
But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself
Who is that calls so coldly
A piece of ice
If thou doubt it thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck
A fire good Curtis
Is my master and his wife coming Grumio
Oh ay Curtis ay and therefore fire fire
Cast on no water
Is she so hot a shrew as shes reported
She was good Curtis before this frost
Why thy horn is a foot and so long am I at the least
I prithee good Grumio tell me how goes the world
Do thy duty and have thy duty for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death
Theres fire ready
And therefore good Grumio the news
Why therefore fire for I have caught extreme cold
Wheres the cook
Is supper ready the house trimmed rushes strewed cobwebs swept the servingmen in their new fustian their white stockings and every officer his wedding garment on
Be the Jacks fair within the Jills fair without the carpets laid and everything in order
For Gods sake a pot of small ale
Will t please your Honor taste of these conserves
What raiment will your Honor wear today
I am Christophero Sly
All ready
And therefore I pray thee news
First know my horse is tired my master and mistress fallen out
How
Out of their saddles into the dirt and thereby hangs a tale
Lets ha t good Grumio
Lend thine ear
Here
There
This tis to feel a tale not to hear a tale
And therefore tis called a sensible tale
And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech listning
Now I begin Imprimis we came down a foul hill my master riding behind my mistress Both of one horse
Whats that to thee
Why a horse
Tell thou the tale
Ay and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home
But what talk I of this
Call forth Nathaniel Joseph Nicholas Philip Walter Sugarsop and the rest
Let their heads be slickly combed their blue coats brushed and their garters of an indifferent knit
Let them curtsy with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair of my masters horsetail till they kiss their hands
Are they all ready
They are
Call them forth  
Why she hath a face of her own
Who knows not that
Thou it seems that calls for company to countenance her
I call them forth to credit her
Why she comes to borrow nothing of them
Welcome home Grumio
How now Grumio
What Grumio
Fellow Grumio
How now old lad
Een at hand alighted by this
Where be these knaves
Here here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms
Where is the foolish knave I sent before
Here sir as foolish as I was before
You peasant swain
You whoreson malthorse drudge
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee
Nathaniels coat sir was not fully made And Gabriels pumps were all unpinked i th heel
There was no link to color Peters hat And Walters dagger was not come from sheathing
There were none fine but Adam Rafe and Gregory
Go rascals go and fetch my supper in
One Kate that you must kiss and be acquainted with Where are my slippers
Shall I have some water Come Kate and wash and welcome heartily You whoreson villain
Will you let it fall
Patience I pray you
Twas a fault unwilling
Will you give thanks sweet Kate or else shall I Whats this
Mutton
Ay
Who brought it
I
What dogs are these
Where is the rascal cook
How durst you villains bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not
There take it to you trenchers cups and all
I pray you husband be not so disquiet
The meat was well if you were so contented
I tell thee Kate twas burnt and dried away
Come I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber
Peter didst ever see the like
He kills her in her own humor
Where is he
Away away for he is coming hither
Thus have I politicly begun my reign And tis my hope to end successfully
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty And till she stoop she must not be fullgorged For then she never looks upon her lure
Another way I have to man my haggard To make her come and know her keepers call
That is to watch her as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient
She ate no meat today nor none shall eat
Last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not
As with the meat some undeservèd fault Ill find about the making of the bed And here Ill fling the pillow there the bolster This way the coverlet another way the sheets
And in conclusion she shall watch all night And if she chance to nod Ill rail and brawl And with the clamor keep her still awake
He that knows better how to tame a shrew Now let him speak tis charity to show
Is t possible friend Litio that mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio
What master read you
First resolve me that
And may you prove sir master of your art
I tell thee Litio this is wonderful
Mistake no more
Know sir that I am called Hortensio
See how they kiss and court
Fie on her
See how beastly she doth court him
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn
For me that I may surely keep mine oath I will be married to a wealthy widow Ere three days pass which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard
And so farewell Signior Lucentio
Kindness in women not their beauteous looks Shall win my love and so I take my leave In resolution as I swore before
What would you make me mad
Am not I Christopher Sly old Slys son of Burton Heath by birth a peddler by education a cardmaker by transmutation a bearherd and now by present profession a tinker
Oh this is it that makes your servants droop
O noble lord bethink thee of thy birth Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment And banish hence these abject lowly dreams
Look how thy servants do attend on thee Each in his office ready at thy beck
Wilt thou have music
Hark
Apollo plays And twenty cagèd nightingales do sing Or wilt thou sleep
Well have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis
Or wilt thou hunt
Nay I have taen you napping gentle love And have forsworn you with Hortensio
Tranio you jest
But have you both forsworn me
Mistress we have
Then we are rid of Litio
I faith hell have a lusty widow now That shall be wooed and wedded in a day
God give him joy
Ay and hell tame her
He says so Tranio
The taming school
What is there such a place
Ay mistress and Petruchio is the master That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue
What is he Biondello
And what of him Tranio
Take in your love and then let me alone
God save you sir
You are welcome
Of Mantua
My life sir
how I pray
For that goes hard
Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua
Know you not the cause
Tis marvel but that you are but newly come You might have heard it else proclaimed about
Alas sir it is worse for me than so For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence and must here deliver them
Ay sir in Pisa have I often been Pisa renownèd for grave citizens
O sir I do and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty
In all these circumstances Ill instruct you
No no forsooth I dare not for my life
The more my wrong the more his spite appears
What did he marry me to famish me
If not elsewhere they meet with charity
But I who never knew how to entreat Nor never needed that I should entreat Am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed
And that which spites me more than all these wants He does it under name of perfect love As who should say if I should sleep or eat Twere deadly sickness or else present death
What say you to a neats foot
Tis passing good
I prithee let me have it
I fear it is too choleric a meat
Good Grumio fetch it me
I cannot tell
I fear tis choleric
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard
Ay but the mustard is too hot a little
Why then the beef and let the mustard rest
Nay then I will not
You shall have the mustard Or else you get no beef of Grumio
Then both or one or anything thou wilt
Why then the mustard without the beef
Go get thee gone I say
Mistress what cheer
Pluck up thy spirits
Here love thou seest how diligent I am To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee
I am sure sweet Kate this kindness merits thanks
What not a word
Nay then thou lovst it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof
Here take away this dish
I pray you let it stand
I thank you sir
Come mistress Kate Ill bear you company
Come tailor let us see these ornaments
Lay forth the gown
What news with you sir
Here is the cap your Worship did bespeak
Why this was molded on a porringer
A velvet dish
Fie fie tis lewd and filthy
Why tis a cockle or a walnut shell A knack a toy a trick a babys cap
Away with it
Come let me have a bigger
Ill have no bigger
When you are gentle you shall have one too And not till then
Why sir I trust I may have leave to speak And speak I will
I am no child no babe
Your betters have endured me say my mind And if you cannot best you stop your ears
Why thou sayst true
It is a paltry cap A custardcoffin a bauble a silken pie
I love thee well in that thou likst it not
Love me or love me not I like the cap And it I will have or I will have none
Thy gown
Why ay
Come tailor let us see t
O mercy God
Whats this
A sleeve
Tis like a demicannon
What up and down carved like an apple tart
Heres snip and nip and cut and slish and slash Like to a censer in a barbers shop
Why what i devils name tailor callst thou this
You bid me make it orderly and well According to the fashion and the time
Marry and did
But if you be remembered I did not bid you mar it to the time
Ill none of it
Hence make your best of it
I never saw a betterfashioned gown More quaint more pleasing nor more commendable
Why true he means to make a puppet of thee
Thou liest thou thread thou thimble Thou yard threequarters halfyard quarter nail
Thou flea thou nit thou winter cricket thou
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread
I tell thee I that thou hast marred her gown
Your Worship is deceived
The gown is made Just as my master had direction
Grumio gave order how it should be done
I gave him no order
I gave him the stuff
But how did you desire it should be made
Marry sir with needle and thread
But did you not request to have it cut
Face not me
Thou hast braved many men brave not me
I will neither be faced nor braved
I say unto thee I bid thy master cutout the gown but I did not bid him cut it to pieces
Why here is the note of the fashion to testify
Read it
The note lies in s throat if he say I said so  
Dost thou love pictures
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods oerrun her lovely face She was the fairest creature in the world And yet she is inferior to none
I confess the cape
I confess two sleeves
Ay theres the villany
Error i the bill sir error i the bill
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again and that Ill prove upon thee though thy little finger be armed in a thimble
I am for thee straight
Take thou the bill give me thy mete yard and spare not me
Godamercy Grumio
Then he shall have no odds
Well sir in brief the gown is not for me
You are i the right sir tis for my mistress
Go take it up unto thy masters use
Villain not for thy life
Take up my mistress gown for thy masters use
Why sir whats your conceit in that
O sir the conceit is deeper than you think for
Take up my mistress gown to his masters use
O fie fie fie
Well come my Kate
What is the jay more precious than the lark Because his feathers are more beautiful
Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye
Oh no good Kate
If thou accountst it shame lay it on me And therefore frolic
We will hence forthwith To feast and sport us at thy fathers house
I dare assure you sir tis almost two And twill be supper time ere you come there
It shall be seven ere I go to horse
Look what I speak or do or think to do You are still crossing it
Sirs let t alone
I will not go today and ere I do It shall be what oclock I say it is  
Ay what else
and but I be deceived Signior Baptista may remember me Near twenty years ago in Genoa Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus
I warrant you
But sir here comes your boy
Tut fear not me
I told him that your father was at Venice And that you looked for him this day in Padua
Here comes Baptista
Set your countenance sir
Signior Baptista you are happily met Sir this is the gentleman I told you of
I pray you stand good father to me now
Give me Bianca for my patrimony
Sir pardon me in what I have to say
Your plainness and your shortness please me well
Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him Or both dissemble deeply their affections
Your son shall have my daughter with consent
Not in my house Lucentio for you know Pitchers have ears and I have many servants
Besides old Gremio is hearkning still And happily we might be interrupted
I pray the gods she may with all my heart
Cambio
What sayest thou Biondello
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you
Biondello what of that
I pray thee moralize them
Then thus Baptista is safe talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son
And what of him
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper
And then
The old priest at Saint Lukes Church is at your command at all hours
And what of all this
I cannot tell except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance
Take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum
To th church take the priest clerk and some sufficient honest witnesses
If this be not that you look for I have no more to say But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day
I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit and so may you sir
And so adieu sir
My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Lukes to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix
She will be pleased
Then wherefore should I doubt
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her
Come on i Gods name once more toward our fathers
Good Lord how bright and goodly shines the moon
The moon
The sun
It is not moonlight now
I say it is the moon that shines so bright
I know it is the sun that shines so bright
Now by my mothers son and thats myself It shall be moon or star or what I list Or eer I journey to your fathers house
I say it is the moon
I know it is the moon
Nay then you lie
It is the blessèd sun
Then God be blessed it is the blessèd sun
Petruchio go thy ways the field is won
Well forward forward
Thus the bowl should run And not unluckily against the bias
But soft
Company is coming here
Young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet Whither away or where is thy abode
Happy the parents of so fair a child
Will t please your Mightiness to wash your hands
O how we joy to see your wit restored
O that once more you knew but what you are
These fifteen years you have been in a dream Or when you waked so waked as if you slept
These fifteen years
By my fay a goodly nap
But did I never speak of all that time
O yes my lord but very idle words
Why sir you know no house nor no such maid Nor no such men as you have reckoned up As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell And twenty more such names and men as these Which never were nor no man ever saw
Why how now Kate
I hope thou art not mad
This is a manold wrinkled faded withered And not a maiden as thou sayst he is
Fair sir and you my merry mistress That with your strange encounter much amazed me My name is called Vincentio my dwelling Pisa And bound I am to Padua there to visit A son of mine which long I have not seen
What is his name
Lucentio gentle sir
Happily met the happier for thy son
The sister to my wife this gentlewoman Thy son by this hath married
Wonder not Nor be grieved
Let me embrace with old Vincentio And wander we to see thy honest son Who will of thy arrival be full joyous
I do assure thee father so it is
Well Petruchio this has put me in heart
Softly and swiftly sir for the priest is ready
I fly Biondello
Nay faith Ill see the church a your back and then come back to my masters as soon as I can
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while
Sir heres the door
This is Lucentios house
My fathers bears more toward the marketplace
Thither must I and here I leave you sir
You shall not choose but drink before you go
Theyre busy within
You were best knock louder
Is Signior Lucentio within sir
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal
Hope I may choose sir
Come hither you rogue
What have you forgot me
Forgot you
No sir
I could not forget you for I never saw you before in all my life
What my old worshipful old master
Yes marry sir
See where he looks out of the window
Is t so indeed
Help help help
Heres a madman will murder me
Oh I am undone I am undone
What is the man lunatic
Thy father
O villain
He is a sailmaker in Bergamo
You mistake sir you mistake sir
Pray what do you think is his name
His name
Lucentio
Oh he hath murdered his master
O my son my son
Tell me thou villain where is my son Lucentio
Carry this mad knave to the jailFather Baptista I charge you see that he be forthcoming
Carry me to the jail
He shall not go to prison
Talk not Signior Gremio
I say he shall go to prison
Take heed Signior Baptista lest you be conycatched in this business
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio   
Nay I dare not swear it
Yes I know thee to be Signior Lucentio
Away with the dotard
To the jail with him
O
We are spoiled and yonder he is
Pardon sweet father
Lives my sweet son
Pardon dear father
How hast thou offended
Where is Lucentio
Heres Lucentio right son to the right Vincentio That have by marriage made thy daughter mine While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne
Heres packing with a witness to deceive us all
Where is that damnèd villain Tranio That faced and braved me in this matter so
Why tell me is not this my Cambio
Cambio is changed into Lucentio
Love wrought these miracles
Biancas love Made me exchange my state with Tranio While he did bear my countenance in the town And happily I have arrivèd at the last Unto the wishèd haven of my bliss
What Tranio did myself enforced him to
Then pardon him sweet father for my sake
Ill slit the villains nose that would have sent me to the jail
But do you hear sir have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill
Fear not Baptista we will content you
Go to
My cake is dough but Ill in among the rest Out of hope of all but my share of the feast
Husband lets follow to see the end of this ado
First kiss me Kate and we will
What in the midst of the street
What art thou ashamed of me
No sir God forbid but ashamed to kiss
Why then lets home again
Nay I will give thee a kiss
Is not this well
Come my sweet Kate
Better once than never for never too late
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends
Amen
I thank thee
Thou shalt not lose by it
How fares my noble lord
Marry I fare well For here is cheer enough
Where is my wife
Here noble lord
What is thy will with her
Are you my wife and will not call me husband
My men should call me lord I am your goodman
My fair Bianca bid my father welcome While I with selfsame kindness welcome thine
My banquet is to close our stomachs up After our great good cheer
Pray you sit down For now we sit to chat as well as eat
Nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat
For both our sakes I would that word were true
Now for my life Hortensio fears his widow
You are very sensible and yet you miss my sense I mean Hortensio is afeard of you
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round
Roundly replied
Mistress how mean you that
Thus I conceive by him
Very well mended
Kiss him for that good widow
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round I pray you tell me what you meant by that
Your husband being troubled with a shrew Measures my husbands sorrow by his woe
And now you know my meaning
A very mean meaning
Right I mean you
To her widow
A hundred marks my Kate does put her down
Thats my office
Spoke like an officer
Ha to thee lad
How likes Gremio these quickwitted folks
Believe me sir they butt together well
Ay but not frighted me
Therefore Ill sleep again
Nay that you shall not
Am I your bird
She hath prevented me
Here Signior Tranio This bird you aimed at though you hit her not Therefore a health to all that shot and missed
A good swift simile but something currish
Tis well sir that you hunted for yourself
Tranio hits you now
I thank thee for that gird good Tranio
He has a little galled me I confess
And as the jest did glance away from me Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright
Now in good sadness son Petruchio I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all
Well I say no
Content
Whats the wager
Twenty crowns
Twenty crowns
Ill venture so much of my hawk or hound But twenty times so much upon my wife
A hundred then
Content
A match
Tis done
Who shall begin
That will I
Go Biondello bid your mistress come to me
I go
Son Ill be your half Bianca comes
Ill have no halves
How
Shes busy and she cannot come Is that an answer
Ay and a kind one too
Pray God sir your wife send you not a worse
I hope better
Now wheres my wife
She says you have some goodly jest in hand
She will not come
She bids you come to her
Worse and worse
I know her answer
What
She will not
Now by my holidam here comes Katherina
What is your will sir that you send for me
Where is your sister and Hortensios wife
They sit conferring by the parlor fire
Go fetch them hither
If they deny to come Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands
Here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder
And so it is
I wonder what it bodes
Marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life And awful rule and right supremacy And to be short what not thats sweet and happy
Now fair befall thee good Petruchio
The wager thou hast won and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns Another dowry to another daughter For she is changed as she had never been
See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion Katherine that cap of yours becomes you not
Off with that bauble throw it underfoot
Lord let me never have a cause to sigh Till I be brought to such a silly pass
Fie
What a foolish duty call you this
I would your duty were as foolish too
The wisdom of your duty fair Bianca Hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime
The more fool you for laying on my duty
We will have no telling
She shall not
I say she shallAnd first begin with her
Fie fie
Unknit that threatning unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord thy king thy governor
Such duty as the subject owes the prince Even such a woman oweth to her husband
And when she is froward peevish sullen sour And not obedient to his honest will What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord
I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace Or seek for rule supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve love and obey
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth Unapt to toil and trouble in the world But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts
Come come you froward and unable worms
My mind hath been as big as one of yours My heart as great my reason haply more To bandy word for word and frown for frown
But now I see our lances are but straws Our strength as weak our weakness past compare That seeming to be most which we indeed least are
Come on and kiss me Kate
Tis a good hearing when children are toward
But a harsh hearing when women are froward
Come Kate well to bed
We three are married but you two are sped
Tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamed so
Madam wife they say that I have dreamed And slept above some fifteen year or more
Ay and the time seems thirty unto me Being all this time abandoned from your bed
Tis muchServants leave me and her alone
Madam undress you and come now to bed
Thrice noble lord let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two Or if not so until the sun be set
For your physicians have expressly charged In peril to incur your former malady That I should yet absent me from your bed
I hope this reason stands for my excuse
Ay it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long
But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again
Your Honors players hearing your amendment Are come to play a pleasant comedy For so your doctors hold it very meet Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life
Let them play it
What household stuff
It is a kind of history
Well well see t
We shall neer be younger
Pisa renownèd for grave citizens Gave me my being and my father first A merchant of great traffic through the world Vincentio come of the Bentivolii
Ill pheeze you in faith
A pair of stocks you rogue
Yare a baggage the Slys are no rogues
Therefore  You will not pay for the glasses you have burst
No not a denier
Go by Saint Jeronimy
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee
I know my remedy
Ill not budge an inch boy
Let him come and kindly
Gramercies Tranio well dost thou advise
But stay awhile
What company is this
Master some show to welcome us to town
I faith sir you shall never need to fear
But if it were doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a threelegged stool And paint your face and use you like a fool
From all such devils good Lord deliver us
And me too good Lord
Maids mild behavior and sobriety
Sister content you in my discontent Sir to your pleasure humbly I subscribe
My books and instruments shall be my company On them to look and practice by myself
Hark Tranio
Signior Baptista will you be so strange
Why will you mew her up Signior Baptista for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue
And for I know she taketh most delight In music instruments and poetry Schoolmasters will I keep within my house Fit to instruct her youth
And so farewellKatherina you may stay For I have more to commune with Bianca
Why and I trust I may go too may I not
What shall I be appointed hours as though belike I knew not what to take and what to leave ha
You may go to the devils dam
Farewell
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Biancas love to labor and effect one thing specially
Whats that I pray
Marry sir to get a husband for her sister
A husband
A devil
I say a husband
I say a devil
Thinkst thou Hortensio though her father be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to hell
Tush Gremio
Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the world an a man could light on them would take her with all faults and money enough
I cannot tell
How say you Signior Gremio
I am agreed and would I had given him the best horse inv Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the house of her
Come on
I pray sir tell me is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold
O Tranio till I found it to be true I never thought it possible or likely
Affection is not rated from the heart
If love have touched you naught remains but so   Gramercies lad go forward
This contents
The rest will comfort for thy counsels sound
Master you looked so longly on the maid Perhaps you marked not whats the pith of all
Oh yes I saw sweet beauty in her face Such as the daughter of Agenor had That made great Jove to humble him to her hand When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand
Saw you no more
Tranio I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air
Ah Tranio what a cruel fathers he
But art thou not advised he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
Ay marry am I sir and now tis plotted
I have it Tranio
Master for my hand Both our inventions meet and jump in one
Tell me thine first
You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid Thats your device
It is
May it be done
Not possible
Tis hatched and shall be so
When Biondello comes he waits on thee But I will charm him first to keep his tongue
Where have I been
Nay how now where are you
Sirrah come hither tis no time to jest And therefore frame your manners to the time
You understand me
Aye sir
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth
Would I were so too
So could I faith boy to have the next wish after That Lucentio indeed had Baptistas youngest daughter
But sirrah not for my sake but your masters I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies
When I am alone why then I am Tranio But in all places else your master Lucentio
Tranio lets go
One thing more rests that thyself execute to make one among these wooers
If thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty
My lord you nod
You do not mind the play
A good matter surely
Comes there any more of it
Tis a very excellent piece of work madam lady
Would twere done
Huntsman I charge thee tender well my hounds
Breathe Merriman the poor cur is embossed And couple Clowder with the deepmouthed brach
Why Belman is as good as he my lord
Trust me I take him for the better dog
Thou art a fool
If Echo were as fleet I would esteem him worth a dozen such
But sup them well and look unto them all
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again
I will my lord
Whats here
One dead or drunk
See doth he breathe
He breathes my lord
Were he not warmed with ale This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly
Grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image
Sirs I will practice on this drunken man
Verona for a while I take my leave To see my friends in Padua but of all My best belovèd and approvèd friend Hortensio
And I trow this is his house
Here sirrah Grumio
Knock I say
Knock sir
Whom should I knock
Is there any man has rebused your Worship
Knock you here sir
Villain I say knock me at this gate And rap me well or Ill knock your knaves pate
My master is grown quarrelsome
How now whats the matter
My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio
How do you all at Verona
Signior Hortensio come you to part the fray
Nay tis no matter sir what he leges in Latin
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it
Knock at the gate
O heavens
Spake you not these words plain Sirrah knock me here rap me here knock me well and knock me soundly
And come you now with knocking at the gate
Petruchio patience
I am Grumios pledge
Why this a heavy chance twixt him and you Your ancient trusty pleasant servant Grumio
And tell me now sweet friend what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona
Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home Where small experience grows
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home And so am come abroad to see the world
Thoudst thank me but a little for my counsel And yet Ill promise thee she shall be rich And very rich
But thourt too much my friend And Ill not wish thee to her
Signior Hortensio twixt such friends as we Few words suffice
I can Petruchio help thee to a wife With wealth enough and young and beauteous Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
Her only fault and that is faults enough Is that she is intolerable curst And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure That were my state far worser than it is I would not wed her for a mine of gold
Hortensio peace
Thou knowst not golds effect
Her father is Baptista Minola An affable and courteous gentleman
Her name is Katherina Minola Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue
I know her father though I know not her And he knew my deceasèd father well
I will not sleep Hortensio till I see her And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter Unless you will accompany me thither
Tarry Petruchio I must go with thee For in Baptistas keep my treasure is
He hath the jewel of my life in hold His youngest daughter beautiful Bianca And her withholds from me and other more Suitors to her and rivals in my love Supposing it a thing impossible For those defects I have before rehearsed That ever Katherina will be wooed
Katherine the curst A title for a maid of all titles the worst
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music to instruct Bianca That so I may by this device at least Have leave and leisure to make love to her And unsuspected court her by herself
Heres no knavery
Master master look about you
Who goes there ha
Peace Grumio
It is the rival of my love
Petruchio stand by a while
O this learning what a thing it is
And you are well met Signior Hortensio
Trow you whither I am going
To Baptista Minola
Tis well
And I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another A fine musician to instruct our mistress
Gremio tis now no time to vent our love
So said so done is well
Hortensio have you told him all her faults
I know she is an irksome brawling scold
If that be all masters I hear no harm
No
Sayst me so friend
What countryman
My father dead my fortune lives for me
And I do hope good days and long to see
O sir such a life with such a wife were strange
But if you have a stomach to t i Gods name You shall have me assisting you in all
But will you woo this wildcat
Why came I hither but to that intent
Have I not heard the sea puffed up with winds Rage like an angry boar chafèd with sweat
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field And heavens artillery thunder in the skies
Hortensio hark
And so we will provided that he win her
I would I were as sure of a good dinner
He that has the two fair daughtersis t he you mean
Not her that chides sir at any hand I pray
Sir a word ere you go
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no
An if I be sir is it any offense
No if without more words you will get you hence
For this reason if youll know That shes the choice love of Signior Gremio
That shes the chosen of Signior Hortensio
Softly my masters
If you be gentlemen Do me this right hear me with patience
Baptista is a noble gentleman To whom my father is not all unknown And were his daughter fairer than she is She may more suitors have and me for one
Believe me lord I think he cannot choose
It would seem strange unto him when he waked
Even as a flattring dream or worthless fancy
Then take him up and manage well the jest
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet
My lord I warrant you we will play our part As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is
Fair Ledas daughter had a thousand wooers Then well one more may fair Bianca have
This gentleman will outtalk us all
Hortensio to what end are all these words
Yea leave that labor to great Hercules And let it be more than Alcides twelve
Sir you say well and well you do conceive
O excellent motion
Fellows lets be gone
The motions good indeed and be it so Petruchio I shall be your 
Good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself To make a bondmaid and a slave of me
That I disdain
See thou dissemble not
Minion thou liest
Is t not Hortensio
Oh then belike you fancy riches more
You will have Gremio to keep you fair
Is it for him you do envy me so
What in my sightBianca get thee in
What will you not suffer me
Talk not to me
But who comes here
Good morrow neighbor Baptista
Good morrow neighbor GremioGod save you gentlemen
And you good sir
Pray have you not a daughter Called Katherina fair and virtuous
I have a daughter sir called Katherina
You wrong me Signior Gremio
Give me leave I am a gentleman of Verona sir That hearing of her beauty and her wit Her affability and bashful modesty Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard
Youre welcome sir and he for your good sake
But for my daughter Katherine this I know She is not for your turn the more my grief
I see you do not mean to part with her Or else you like not of my company
Mistake me not
I speak but as I find
Whence are you sir
What may I call your name
Petruchio is my name Antonios son A man well known throughout all Italy
I know him well
You are welcome for his sake
Oh pardon me Signior Gremio I would fain be doing
I doubt it not sir but you will curse your wooing Neighbor this is a gift very grateful I am sure of it
To express the like kindness myself that have been more kindly beholding to you than any freely give unto you this young scholar 
A thousand thanks Signior Gremio
Welcome good Cambio
Lucentio is your name
Of whence I pray
A mighty man of Pisa
By report I know him well
You are very welcome sir
We will go walk a little in the orchard And then to dinner
You are passing welcome And so I pray you all to think yourselves
Signior Baptista my business asketh haste And every day I cannot come to woo
You knew my father well and in him me Left solely heir to all his lands and goods Which I have bettered rather than decreased
Then tell me if I get your daughters love What dowry shall I have with her to wife
After my death the one half of my lands And in possession twenty thousand crowns
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us That covenants may be kept on either hand
Ay when the special thing is well obtained That is her love for that is all in all
Why that is nothing
For I tell you father I am as peremptory as she proudminded And where two raging fires meet together They do consume the thing that feeds their fury
So I to her and so she yields to me For I am rough and woo not like a babe
Well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
But be thou armed for some unhappy words
Ay to the proof as mountains are for winds That shakes not though they blow perpetually
How now my friend why dost thou look so pale
What will my daughter prove a good musician
I think shell sooner prove a soldier
Why then thou canst not break her to the lute
Ill fume with them And with that word she struck me on the head And through the instrument my pate made way
Now by the world it is a lusty wench
I love her ten times more than eer I did
Oh how I long to have some chat with her
I pray you do
Ill attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes
Say that she rail why then Ill tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale
Say that she frown Ill say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew
Say she be mute and will not speak a word Then Ill commend her volubility And say she uttereth piercing eloquence
If she do bid me pack Ill give her thanks As though she bid me stay by her a week
If she deny to wed Ill crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be marrièd
Take him up gently and to bed with him And each one to his office when he wakes
Sirrah go see what trumpet tis that sounds
Belike some noble gentleman that means Traveling some journey to repose him here
Ant please your Honor players That offer service to your Lordship
Bid them come near
Now fellows you are welcome
We thank your Honor
Do you intend to stay with me tonight
So please your Lordship to accept our duty
With all my heart
This fellow I remember Since once he played a farmers eldest son
Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well
I have forgot your name but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally performed
Good morrow Katefor thats your name I hear
Well have you heard but something hard of hearing
Moved in good time
I knew you at the first You were a moveable
Why whats a moveable
A joint stool
Thou hast hit it
Come sit on me
Asses are made to bear and so are you
Women are made to bear and so are you
No such jade as you if me you mean
Alas good Kate I will not burden thee For knowing thee to be but young and light Too light for such a swain as you to catch And yet as heavy as my weight should be
Should beshould buzz
If I be waspish best beware my sting
My remedy is then to pluck it out
Ay if the fool could find it where it lies
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting
In his tail
In his tongue
Whose tongue
Yours if you talk of tales
What with my tongue in your tail
Nay come again Good Kate
That Ill try
I swear Ill cuff you if you strike again
So may you lose your arms
No cock of mine
Nay come Kate come
You must not look so sour
It is my fashion when I see a crab
Why heres no crab and therefore look not sour
There is there is
Then show it me
Had I a glass I would
What you mean my face
Well aimed of such a young one
Now by Saint George I am too young for you
Yet you are withered
Tis with cares
I care not
Let me go
No not a whit
I find you passing gentle
Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen And now I find report a very liar
Thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk
But thou with mildness entertainst thy wooers With gentle conference soft and affable
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp
O slanderous world
Kate like the hazeltwig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels
Oh let me see thee walk
Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait
A witty mother
Witless else her son
Am I not wise
For I am he am born to tame you Kate And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates
I should know that voice
It should beBut he is drowned and these are devils
Oh defend me
Four legs and two voicesa most delicate monster
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend
His backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him I will help his ague
Come
Stephano
Doth thy other mouth call me
Mercy mercy
This is a devil and no monster
I will leave him
I have no long spoon
Stephano
If thou beest Stephano touch me and speak to me
For I am Trinculobe not afeardthy good friend Trinculo
If thou beest Trinculo come forth
Ill pull thee by the lesser legs
If any be Trinculos legs these are they 
But art thou not drowned Stephano
I hope now thou art not drowned
Is the storm overblown
I hid me under the dead mooncalfs gaberdine for fear of the storm
And art thou living Stephano
O Stephano two Neapolitans scaped
Prithee do not turn me about
My stomach is not constant
Swum ashore man like a duck
I can swim like a duck Ill be sworn
Here kiss the book
O Stephano hast any more of this
The whole butt man
Hast thou not dropped from heaven
Out o th moon I do assure thee
I was the man i the moon when time was
My mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush
I afeard of him
A very weak monster
The man i th moon
A most poor credulous monsterWell drawn monster in good sooth
By this light a most perfidious and drunken monster
When s gods asleep hell rob his bottle
Come on then
Down and swear
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppyheaded monster
A most scurvy monster
I could find in my heart to beat him   But that the poor monsters in drink
An abominable monster
Ill show thee the best springs
Ill pluck thee berries
Ill fish for thee and get thee wood enough
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve
A most ridiculous monster to make a wonder of a poor drunkard
I prithee now lead the way without any more talking Trinculo the king and all our company else being drowned we will inherit hereHere bear my bottleFellow Trinculo well fill him by and by again 
A howling monster a drunken monster
O brave monster
Lead the way
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground long heath brown furze anything
Some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone
And most poor matters Point to rich ends
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious but The mistress which I serve quickens whats dead And makes my labors pleasures
Oh she is Ten times more gentle than her fathers crabbed And hes composed of harshness
I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up Upon a sore injunction
My sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness Had never like executor
I forget But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors Most busiest when I do it
Alas now pray you Work not so hard
I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile
Pray set it down and rest you
When this burns Twill weep for having wearied you
My father Is hard at study
Pray now rest yourself
Hes safe for these three hours
O most dear mistress The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do
If youll sit down Ill bear your logs the while
Pray give me that
Ill carry it to the pile
It would become me As well as it does you and I should do it With much more ease for my good will is to it And yours it is against
You look wearily
I do beseech you Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers What is your name
MirandaO my father I have broke your hest to say so
Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time
For several virtues Have I liked several women
But you O you So perfect and so peerless are created Of every creatures best
I do not know One of my sex no womans face remember Save from my glass mine own
Nor have I seen More that I may call men than you good friend And my dear father
I am in my condition A prince MirandaI do think a king I would not soand would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The fleshfly blow my mouth
Hear my soul speak
The very instant that I saw you did My heart fly to your service there resides To make me slave to it and for your sake Am I this patient logman
Do you love me
O heaven O earth bear witness to this sound And crown what I profess with kind event
If I speak true
I Beyond all limit of what else i th world Do love prize honor you
I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of
Wherefore weep you
At mine unworthiness that dare not offer What I desire to give and much less take What I shall die to want
But this is trifling And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows
I am your wife if you will marry me
If not Ill die your maid
To be your fellow You may deny me but Ill be your servant Whether you will or no
My mistress dearest and I thus humble ever
My husband then
A thousand thousand
Ill to my book For yet ere suppertime must I perform Much business appertaining
Tell not me
When the butt is out we will drink water
Not a drop before
Therefore bear up and board emServant monster drink to me
Servantmonster
The folly of this island
They say theres but five upon this isle
We are three of them
If th other two be brained like us the state totters
Drink servantmonster when I bid thee
Thy eyes are almost set in thy head
Where should they be set else
He were a brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail
For my part the sea cannot drown me
Hes no standard
Well not run Monsieur Monster
Nor go neither
But youll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither 
Mooncalf speak once in thy life if thou beest a good mooncalf
How does thy honor
Let me lick thy shoe
Lord quoth he
That a monster should be such a natural
Trinculo keep a good tongue in your head
If you prove a mutineer the next tree
I thank my noble lord
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee
I will stand and so shall Trinculo
Thou liest
Trinculo if you trouble him any more in s tale by this hand I will supplant some of your teeth
Why I said nothing
Mum then and no more
Proceed
I say by sorcery he got this isle
From me he got it
If thy greatness will Revenge it on himfor I know thou darest But this thing dare not Thats most certain
Thou shalt be lord of it and Ill serve thee
How now shall this be compassed
Canst thou bring me to th party
Yea yea my lord
Ill yield him thee asleep Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head
Thou liest
Thou canst not
