What a pied ninnys thisThou scurvy patch I do beseech thy greatness give him blows And take his bottle from him
When thats gone He shall drink naught but brine for Ill not show him Where the quick freshes are
Trinculo run into no further danger
Interrupt the monster one word further and by this hand Ill turn my mercy out o doors and make a stockfish of thee
Why what did I
I did nothing
Ill go farther off
Didst thou not say he lied
Thou liest
I did not give the lie
Out o your wits and hearing too
A pox o your bottle
Ha ha ha
Now forward with your talePrithee stand farther off
Beat him enough
After a little time Ill beat him too
Why as I told thee tis a custom with him I th afternoon to sleep
There thou mayst brain him Having first seized his books or with a log Batter his skull or paunch him with a stake Or cut his weasand with thy knife
Remember First to possess his books for without them Hes but a sot as I am nor hath not One spirit to command
They all do hate him As rootedly as I
Burn but his books
He has brave utensilsfor so he calls them Which when he has a house hell deck withal
And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter
He himself Calls her a nonpareil
I never saw a woman But only Sycorax my dam and she
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As greatst does least
Is it so brave a lass
Ay lord
Monster I will kill this man
His daughter and I will be king and queensave our gracesand Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroysDost thou like the plot Trinculo
Excellent
Give me thy hand
I am sorry I beat thee
But while thou livest keep a good tongue in thy head
Within this half hour will he be asleep
Wilt thou destroy him then 
If by your art my dearest father you have Put the wild waters in this roar allay them
The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch But that the sea mounting to th welkins cheek Dashes the fire out
Oh I have suffered With those that I saw suffer
A brave vessel Who had no doubt some noble creature in her Dashed all to pieces
Oh the cry did knock Against my very heart
Poor souls they perished
Had I been any god of power I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her
Be collected
No more amazement
Tell your piteous heart Theres no harm done
Oh woe the day
No harm
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts
Ay on mine honor
Thou makest me merry
I am full of pleasure
Let us be jocund
At thy request monster I will do reason any reason Come on Trinculo let us sing
Thats not the tune
What is this same
O forgive me my sins
Art thou afeard
No monster not I
Be not afeard
This will prove a brave kingdom to me where I shall have my music for nothing
When Prospero is destroyed
That shall be by and by
I remember the story
The sound is going away
Lets follow it and after do our work
Lead monster well follow
I would I could see this taborer
He lays it on
Wilt come
My old bones ache
Heres a maze trod indeed Through forthrights and meanders
By your patience I needs must rest me
Old lord I cannot blame thee Who am myself attached with weariness To th dulling of my spirits
Sit down and rest
He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land
Well let him go
What harmony is this
My good friends hark
Marvelous sweet music
Give us kind keepers heavens
What were these
Now I will believe That there are unicorns that in Arabia There is one tree the phoenix throne one phoenix At this hour reigning there
Travelers neer did lie Though fools at home condemn em
If in Naples I should report this now would they believe me
If I should say I saw such islanders For certes these are people of the island Who though they are of monstrous shape yet note Their manners are more gentlekind than of Our human generation you shall find Manynay almost any
They vanished strangely
No matter since They have left their viands behind for we have stomachs
Will t please you taste of what is here
Not I
Faith sir you need not fear
Brother my lord the duke Stand to and do as we
Oh it is monstrous monstrous
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it The winds did sing it to me and the thunder That deep and dreadful organ pipe pronounced The name of Prosper
It did bass my trespass
Therefore my son i th ooze is bedded and Ill seek him deeper than eer plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded
But one fiend at a time Ill fight their legions oer
Ill be thy second
All three of them are desperate
Their great guilt Like poison given to work a great time after Now gins to bite the spirits
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to
Follow I pray you
But If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be ministered No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow but barren hate Soureyed disdain and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both
Fairly spoke
Sit then and talk with her
She is thine own What Ariel
My industrious servant Ariel
What would my potent master
Here I am
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform and I must use you In such another trick
Go bring the rabble Oer whom I give thee power here to this place
It is my promise And they expect it from me
Presently
Ay with a twink
Before you can say Come and Go And breathe twice and cry So so Each one tripping on his toe
Tis time I should inform thee farther
Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me
Not yet      The hours now come
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell
I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not Out three years old
Certainly sir I can
By what
By any other house or person
Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance
Dearly my delicate Ariel
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call
Well I conceive
I warrant you sir The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver
Well Now come my Ariel
Bring a corollary Rather than want a spirit
Appear and pertly No tongue
All eyes
Be silent
Ceres most bounteous lady thy rich leas Of wheat rye barley vetches oats and peas Thy turfy mountains where live nibbling sheep And flat meads thatched with stover them to keep Thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims
Why hath thy queen Summoned me hither to this shortgrassed green
A contract of true love to celebrate And some donation freely to estate On the blessed lovers
Tell me heavenly bow If Venus or her son as thou dost know Do now attend the queen
Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got Her and her blind boys scandaled company I have forsworn
Of her society Be not afraid
I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son Dovedrawn with her
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid Whose vows are that no bedright shall be paid Till Hymens torch be lightedbut in vain
Marss hot minion is returned again
Her waspishheaded son has broke his arrows Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows And be a boy right out
Highest queen of state Great Juno comes
I know her by her gait
How does my bounteous sister
Go with me To bless this twain that they may prosperous be And honored in their issue
This is a most majestic vision and Harmonious charmingly
May I be bold To think these spirits
Spirits which by mine art I have from their confines called to enact My present fancies
Let me live here ever
So rare a wondered father and a wife Makes this place paradise
Sweet now silence
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously
Theres something else to do
Hush and be mute Or else our spell is marred
Come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate A contract of true love
Be not too late
You sunburnt sicklemen of August weary Come hither from the furrow and be merry
Your ryestraw hats put on And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing
The minute of their plot Is almost comeWell done
Never till this day Saw I him touched with anger so distempered
We are such stuff As dreams are made on and our little life Is rounded with a sleep
Sir I am vexed
Bear with my weakness
My old brain is troubled
Be not disturbed with my infirmity
If you be pleased retire into my cell And there repose
A turn or two Ill walk To still my beating mind
We wish your peace
Come with a thought
I thank thee Ariel
Come
Thy thoughts I cleave to
Whats thy pleasure
Spirit We must prepare to meet with Caliban
Ay my commander
When I presented Ceres I thought to have told thee of it but I feared Lest I might anger thee
Say again where didst thou leave these varlets
I told you sir they were redhot with drinking So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces beat the ground For kissing of their feetyet always bending Towards their project
Then I beat my tabor At which like unbacked colts they pricked their ears Advanced their eyelids lifted up their noses As they smelt music
So I charmed their ears That calflike they my lowing followed through Toothed briers sharp furzes pricking gorse and thorns Which entered their frail shins
At last I left them I th filthymantled pool beyond your cell There dancing up to th chins that the foul lake Oerstunk their feet
This was well done my bird
Thy shape invisible retain thou still
The trumpery in my house go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves
I go I go
A devil a born devil on whose nature Nurture can never stick on whom my pains Humanely taken all all lost quite lost
And as with age his body uglier grows So his mind cankers
I will plague them all Even to roaring
Come hang them on this line
Pray you tread softly that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall
We now are near his cell
Monster your fairy which you say is a harmless fairy has done little better than played the jack with us
Monster I do smell all horse piss at which my nose is in great indignation
So is mineDo you hear monster
If I should take a displeasure against you look you  Thou wert but a lost monster
Good my lord give me thy favor still
Be patient for the prize Ill bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance
Therefore speak softly
Alls hushed as midnight yet
Thats more to me than my wetting
Yet this is your harmless fairy monster
Prithee my king be quiet
Seest thou here This is the mouth o th cell
No noise and enter
Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever and I thy Caliban For aye thy footlicker
Give me thy hand
I do begin to have bloody thoughts
Let it alone thou fool
It is but trash
Oh ho monster we know what belongs to a frippery   Put off that gown Trinculo
By this hand Ill have that gown
Thy grace shall have it
The dropsy drown this fool
What do you mean To dote thus on such luggage
Lets alone And do the murder first
If he awake From toe to crown hell fill our skins with pinches Make us strange stuff
Do do
I thank thee for that jest
Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country
Theres another garment for t
Monster come put some lime upon your fingers and away with the rest
I will have none on t
Monster lay to your fingers
Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is or Ill turn you out of my kingdom
Go to carry this
And this
Ay and this
Hey Mountain hey
Silver
There it goes Silver
Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants
Had I not Four or five women once that tended me
Thou hadst and more Miranda
But how is it That this lives in thy mind
If thou rememberest aught ere thou camest here How thou camest here thou mayst
But that I do not
Twelve year since Miranda twelve year since Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power
Sir are not you my father
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter
And thy father Was Duke of Milan and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued
Oh the heavens
What foul play had we that we came from thence
Or blessè was t we did
Both both my girl
By foul play as thou sayst were we heaved thence But blessedly holp hither
Fury FuryThere Tyrant there
Hark hark
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions shorten up their sinews With agèd cramps and more pinchspotted make them Than pard or cat o mountain
Hark they roar
Let them be hunted soundly
At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies
Shortly shall all my labors end and thou Shalt have the air at freedom
For a little Follow and do me service
Now does my project gather to a head
My charms crack not my spirits obey and time Goes upright with his carriage
Hows the day
On the sixth hour at which time my lord You said our work should cease
I did say so When first I raised the tempest
Say my spirit How fares the king and s followers
Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge Just as you left them all prisoners sir In the line grove which weatherfends your cell
They cannot budge till your release
The king His brother and yours abide all three distracted And the remainder mourning over them Brimful of sorrow and dismay
But chiefly Him that you termed sir the good old Lord Gonzalo His tears run down his beard like winters drops From eaves of reeds
Your charm so strongly works em That if you now beheld them your affections Would become tender
Dost thou think so spirit
Mine would sir were I human
And mine shall
The rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance
Go release them Ariel
My charms Ill break their senses Ill restore And they shall be themselves
Ill fetch them sir
With his own bolt     the strongbased promontory Have I made shake and by the spurs plucked up The pine and cedar graves at my command Have waked their sleepers oped and let em forth By my so potent art
But this rough magic I here abjure and when I have required Some heavenly music which even now I do To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for Ill break my staff Bury it certain fathoms in the earth And deeper than did ever plummet sound Ill drown my book
A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains Now useless boiled within thy skullThere stand For you are spellstopped   Mine eyes evn sociable to the show of thine Fall fellowly drops
Why thats my dainty Ariel
I shall miss thee But yet thou shalt have freedomSo so so To the kings ship invisible as thou art
All torment trouble wonder and amazement Inhabits here
This must crave An if this be at alla most strange story
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs
But how should Prospero Be living and be here
Whether this be Or be not Ill not swear
Welcome my friends all
The devil speaks in him
You the like loss
As great to me as late
And supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you for I Have lost my daughter
A daughter
O heavens that they were living both in Naples The king and queen there
That they were I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son liesWhen did you lose your daughter
In this last tempest
I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth their words Are natural breathBut howsoevr you have Been justled from your senses know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan who most strangely Upon this shore where you were wracked was landed To be the lord on t
No my dearest love I would not for the world
If this prove A vision of the Island one dear son Shall I twice lose
A most high miracle
Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about
Arise and say how thou camest here
Oh wonder
How many goodly creatures are there here
How beauteous mankind is
O brave new world That has such people in t
Tis new to thee
Sir she is mortal
But by immortal providence shes mine
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice nor thought I had one
She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan Of whom so often I have heard renown But never saw before of whom I have Received a second life
And second father This lady makes him to me
I am hers
But oh how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness
There sir stop
Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness thats gone
Oh my heart bleeds To think o th teen that I have turned you to Which is from my remembrance
Please you farther
My brother and thy uncle called Antonio I pray thee mark me that a brother should Be so perfidious
he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state as at that time Through all the signories it was the first And Prospero the prime duke being so reputed In dignity and for the liberal arts Without a parallel
Those being all my study The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger being transported And rapt in secret studies
Thy false uncle Dost thou attend me
Sir most heedfully
O good sir I do
Look down you gods And on this couple drop a blessèd crown For it is you that have chalked forth the way Which brought us hither
I say amen Gonzalo
Was Milan thrust from Milan that his issue Should become kings of Naples
O rejoice Beyond a common joy and set it down With gold on lasting pillars
In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis And Ferdinand her brother found a wife Where he himself was lost Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle and all of us ourselves When no man was his own
Be it so
Amen
Oh look sir look sir
Here is more of us
The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company
The next our ship Which but three glasses since we gave out split Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea
These are not natural events
On a trice so please you Even in a dream were we divided from them And were brought moping hither    
This is as strange a maze as eer men trod And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of
Some oracle Must rectify our knowledge
Sir my liege Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business
How fares my gracious sir
Coraggio bullymonster  If these be true spies which I wear in my head heres a goodly sight
O Setebos these be brave spirits indeed
How fine my master is
I am afraid He will chastise me
Ha ha
What things are these my lord Antonio
Will money buy em
I shall be pinched to death
Is not this Stephano my drunken butler
He is drunk now
Where had he wine
And Trinculo is reeling ripe
Why how now Stephano
O touch me not
I am not Stephano but a cramp
Youd be king o th isle sirrah
I should have been a sore one then
He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape Take with you your companions
And Ill be wise hereafter And seek for grace
What a thricedouble ass Was I to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool
Go to away
Or stole it rather
And in the morn Ill bring you to your ship and so to Naples Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dearbelovèd solemnized And thence retire me to my Milan where Every third thought shall be my grave
I long To hear the story of your life which must Take the ear strangely
Now my charms are all oerthrown And what strength I haves mine own Which is most faint
Let me not Since I have my dukedom got And pardoned the deceiver dwell In this bare island by your spell But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands
As you from crimes would pardoned be Let your indulgence set me free
I pray thee mark me
I thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which but by being so retired Oerprized all popular rate in my false brother Awaked an evil nature
And my trust Like a good parent did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was which had indeed no limit A confidence sans bound
Hence his ambition growing Dost thou hear
Your tale sir would cure deafness
Me poor man my library Was dukedom large enough
Oh the heavens
Mark his condition and the event
Then tell me If this might be a brother
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother
The King of Naples being an enemy To me inveterate hearkens my brothers suit Which was that he in lieu o th premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan With all the honors on my brother
Alack for pity
I not remembering how I cried out then Will cry it oer again
It is a hint That wrings mine eyes to t
Hear a little further And then Ill bring thee to the present business Which now s upon s without the which this story Were most impertinent
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us
Well demanded wench
My tale provokes that question
Dear they durst not So dear the love my people bore me nor set A mark so bloody on the business but With colors fairer painted their foul ends
Alack what trouble Was I then to you
Oh a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me
Thou didst smile Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven When I have decked the sea with drops full salt Under my burthen groaned which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue
How came we ashore
By providence divine
Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo Out of his charity who being then appointed Master of this design did give us with Rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries Which since have steaded much
So of his gentleness Knowing I loved my books he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom
Would I might But ever see that man
Now I arise
Heavens thank you for t
And now I pray you sir For still tis beating in my mindyour reason For raising this sea storm
Know thus far forth By accident most strange bountiful Fortune Now my dear lady hath mine enemies Brought to this shore
Here cease more questions
Tis a good dullness And give it way
I know thou canst not choose
Come away servant come
I am ready now
Approach my Ariel come
All hail great master
Grave sir hail
Hast thou spirit Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee
Sometime Id divide And burn in many places
Joves lightning the precursors O th dreadful thunderclaps more momentary And sightoutrunning were not
My brave spirit
Boatswain
Here master
What cheer
Good speak to th mariners
Fall to t yarely or we run ourselves aground
Wheres the Master
Play the men
I pray now keep below
Where is the Master Boatswain
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation
All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel Then all afire with me
The kings son Ferdinand With hair upstaringthen like reeds not hair Was the first man that leaped cried Hell is empty And all the devils are here      Why thats my spirit
But was not this nigh shore
Close by my master
But are they Ariel safe
Not a hair perished
On their sustaining garments not a blemish But fresher than before
And as thou badest me In troops I have dispersed them bout the isle
The kings son have I landed by himself Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle and sitting His arms in this sad knot
Of the kings ship The mariners say how thou hast disposed And all the rest o th fleet
The mariners all under hatches stowed Who with a charm joined to their suffered labor I have left asleep
And for the rest o th fleet Which I dispersed they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float Bound sadly home for Naples Supposing that they saw the kings ship wracked And his great person perish
Ariel thy charge Exactly is performed
But theres more work
What is the time o th day
Past the mid season
At least two glasses
The time twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously
Is there more toil
Since thou dost give me pains Let me remember thee what thou hast promised Which is not yet performed me
How now
Moody
What is t thou canst demand
My liberty
Before the time be out
No more
I prithee Remember I have done thee worthy service Told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served Without or grudge or grumblings
Thou didst promise To bate me a full year
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee
No
Thou dost and thinkst it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep To run upon the sharp wind of the north To do me business in the veins o th earth When it is baked with frost
I do not sir
Thou liest malignant thing
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop
Hast thou forgot her
No sir
Thou hast
Where was she born
Speak
Tell me
Sir in Argier
Oh was she so
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been Which thou forgetst
This damned witch Sycorax For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing from Argier Thou knowst was banished
For one thing she did They would not take her life
Is not this true
Ay sir
This blueeyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th sailors
Thou my slave As thou reportst thyself wast then her servant
And for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorred commands Refusing her grand hests she did confine thee By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage Into a cloven pine within which rift Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain A dozen years within which space she died And left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike
Dull thing I say so
He that Caliban Whom now I keep in service
It was mine art When I arrived and heard thee that made gape The pine and let thee out
I thank thee master
If thou more murmurst I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters
Pardon master
I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently
Do so and after two days I will discharge thee
Thats my noble master
What shall I do
Say what
What shall I do
Go make thyself like a nymph o th sea
Be subject To no sight but thine and mine invisible To every eyeball else
Go take this shape And hither come in t
Go hence with diligence
Shake it off
Come on
Well visit Caliban my slave who never Yields us kind answer
But as tis We cannot miss him
He does make our fire Fetch in our wood and serves in offices That profit usWhat ho
Slave
Caliban
Speak
Come forth I say
Theres other business for thee
Come thou tortoise
Fine apparition
My quaint Ariel Hark in thine ear
My lord it shall be done
As wicked dew as eer my mother brushed With ravens feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both
A southwest blow on ye And blister you all oer
For this be sure tonight thou shalt have cramps Sidestitches that shall pen thy breath up
Urchins Shall forth at vast of night that they may work All exercise on thee
Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging Than bees that made em
I must eat my dinner
This islands mine by Sycorax my mother Which thou takest from me
Cursed be I that did so
Thou most lying slave Whom stripes may move not kindness
I have used thee Filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate The honor of my child
Oh ho oh ho
Would t had been done
Thou didst prevent me
Abhorrèd slave Which any print of goodness wilt not take Being capable of all ill
I pitied thee Took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour One thing or other
But thy vile race Though thou didst learn had that in t which good natures Could not abide to be with
Therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock Who hadst deserved more than a prison
You taught me language and my profit on t Is I know how to curse
The red plague rid you For learning me your language
No pray thee
So slave hence
The watchdogs bark
Hark hark
I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry Cockadiddledow Where should this music be
I th air or th earth
It sounds no more and sure it waits upon Some god o th island
Sitting on a bank Weeping again the king my fathers wrack This music crept by me upon the waters Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air
Thence I have followed it Or it hath drawn me rather
But tis gone
No it begins again
Hark now I hear them
The ditty does remember my drowned father
I hear it now above me
What is t
A spirit
Lord how it looks about
Believe me sir It carries a brave form
But tis a spirit
No wench
It eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have such
He hath lost his fellows And strays about to find em
Do you not hear him
You mar our labor
Keep your cabins
You do assist the storm
Nay good be patient
Hence
To cabin silence
Trouble us not
Good yet remember whom thou hast aboard
None that I more love than myself
You are a councilor
Use your authority
If you cannot give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour if it so hapCheerly good heartsOut of our way I say
I have great comfort from this fellow
I might call him A thing divine for nothing natural I ever saw so noble
No wonder sir But certainly a maid
My language
Heavens I am the best of them that speak this speech Were I but where tis spoken
How
The best
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee
A single thing as I am now that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples
He does hear me And that he does I weep
Myself am Naples Who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld The king my father wracked
Alack for mercy
Yes faith and all his lords the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain
Soft sir
One word more
If the ill spirit have so fair a house Good things will strive to dwell with t
What I say
Come from thy ward For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop
Beseech you father
Hence
Hang not on my garments
Sir have pity Ill be his surety
Silence
One word more Shall make me chide thee if not hate thee
What An advocate for an imposter
Hush Thou thinkst there is no more such shapes as he Having seen but him and Caliban
Foolish wench To th most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels
My affections Are then most humble
I have no ambition To see a goodlier man
So they are
My spirits as in a dream are all bound up
My fathers loss the weakness which I feel The wrack of all my friends nor this mans threats To whom I am subdued are but light to me Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid
Space enough Have I in such a prison          
Prithee peace
A dollar
Dolor comes to him indeed
You have spoken truer than you purposed
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should
Well I have done
But yet   Which of he or Adrian for a good wager first begins to crow
The old cock
The cockerel
Done
The wager
A laughter
A match
Though this island seem to be desert  
It must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance
Temperance was a delicate wench
Ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly
Or as twere perfumed by a fen
Here is everything advantageous to life
True
Save means to live
Of that theres none or little
How lush and lusty the grass looks
How green
The ground indeed is tawny
With an eye of green in t
He misses not much
No he doth but mistake the truth totally
But the rarity of it iswhich is indeed almost beyond credit  As many vouched rarities are
That our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather newdyed than stained with salt water
Ay or very falsely pocket up his report
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric at the marriage of the kings fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis
Twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen
Widow Dido said you
You make me study of that
She was of Carthage not of Tunis
Carthage
I assure you Carthage
His word is more than the miraculous harp
What impossible matter will he make easy next
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands
Ay
Why in good time  
Down with the topmast
Yare lower lower
Bring her to try wi th main course
A plague upon this howling
They are louder than the weather or our office
Yet again
What do you here
Shall we give oer and drown
Have you a mind to sink
Ill warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench
Lay her ahold ahold
All lost
To prayers to prayers all lost
And the rarest that eer came there
Bate I beseech you widow Dido
Oh widow Dido
Ay widow Dido
Is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it
I mean in a sort
That sort was well fished for
When I wore it at your daughters marriage
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense
Sir he may live
I not doubt He came alive to land
No no hes gone
Prithee peace
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience at Which end o th beam should bow
We have lost your son I fear forever
Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business making Than we bring men to comfort them
The faults your own
So is the dearest o th loss
My lord Sebastian The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in
You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster
Very well
And most chirurgeonly
Foul weather
Very foul
Had I plantation of this isle my lord Hed sow t with nettle seed
Or docks or mallows
And were the king on t what would I do
Scape being drunk for want of wine
For no kind of traffic Would I admit
No occupation
No sovereignty     Yet he would be king on t
All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavor
But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison all abundance To feed my innocent people
No marrying mong his subjects
None man
Prithee no more
Thou dost talk nothing to me
Twas you we laughed at
What a blow was there given
An it had not fallen flatlong
You are gentlemen of brave mettle
You would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing
We would so and then go abatfowling
No I warrant you
Go sleep and hear us
What all so soon asleep
I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts
Please you sir Do not omit the heavy offer of it
It seldom visits sorrow
We two my lord Will guard your person while you take your rest And watch your safety
Thank you
Wondrous heavy
What a strange drowsiness possesses them
It is the quality o th climate
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink
I find not Myself disposed to sleep
Nor I
My spirits are nimble
They fell together all as by consent
Th occasion speaks thee and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head
What art thou waking
Do you not hear me speak
I do and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speakst Out of thy sleep
What is it thou didst say
Thou dost snore distinctly
Theres meaning in thy snores
Ill teach you how to flow
Do so
Oh If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it
How in stripping it You more invest it
Ebbing men indeed Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth
Prithee say on
I have no hope That hes undrowned
Oh out of that no hope What great hope have you
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond But doubt discovery there
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned
Hes gone
Then tell me Whos the next heir of Naples
Claribel
Tis true my brothers daughters Queen of Tunis So is she heir of Naples twixt which regions There is some space
I myself could make A chough of as deep chat
Oh that you bore The mind that I do what a sleep were this For your advancement
Methinks I do
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune
I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero
My brothers servants Were then my fellows
Now they are my men
But for your conscience
Ay sir
But I feel not This deity in my bosom
Should not upbraid our course
For all the rest Theyll take suggestion as a cat laps milk
Theyll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour
Thy case dear friend Shall be my precedent
As thou gotst Milan Ill come by Naples
Draw thy sword
One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest
And I the king shall love thee
Draw together
And when I rear my hand do you the like To fall it on Gonzalo
O but one word
What must our mouths be cold
The king and prince at prayers
Im out of patience
Hell be hanged yet though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him
Lets all sink wi th king
Lets take leave of him
Then let us both be sudden
Why are you drawn
Wherefore this ghastly looking
Whats the matter
Whiles we stood here securing your repose Even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls or rather lions
Did t not wake you
It struck mine ear most terribly
I heard nothing
Oh twas a din to fright a monsters ear To make an earthquake
Sure it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions
Heard you this Gonzalo
Upon mine honor sir I heard a humming And that a strange one too which did awake me
I shaked you sir and cried
As mine eyes opened I saw their weapons drawn
There was a noise Thats verily
Lets draw our weapons
Heavens keep him from these beasts
For he is sure i th island
Lead away
His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse
But theyll nor pinch Fright me with urchinshows pitch me i th mire Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark Out of my way unless he bid em
Sometime am I All wound with adders who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness
Lo now lo
Perchance he will not mind me
Heres neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all
And another storm brewing I hear it sing i th wind
Yond same black cloud yond huge one looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor
A strange fish
Were I in England now as once I was and had but this fish painted not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver
There would this monster make a man
Any strange beast there makes a man
When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian
Legged like a man and his fins like arms
Warm o my troth
I do now let loose my opinion hold it no longer this is no fish but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt
Alas the storm is come again
My best way is to creep under his gaberdine
There is no other shelter hereabouts
Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows
I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a mans funeral
Well heres my comfort
Do not torment me
Oh
Whats the matter
Have we devils here
Do you put tricks upon s with savages and men of Ind ha
I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs
The spirit torments me
Oh
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got as I take it an ague
Where the devil should he learn our language
I will give him some relief if it be but for that
If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him hes a present for any emperor that ever trod on neats leather
Do not torment me prithee
Ill bring my wood home faster
Hes in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest
He shall taste of my bottle
If he have never drunk wine afore it will go near to remove his fit
If I can recover him and keep him tame I will not take too much for him
He shall pay for him that hath him and that soundly
Lie thou there throwing down a letter for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling
Maria once told me she did affect me and I have heard herself come thus near that should she fancy it should be one of my complexion
Besides she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her
What should I think on t
To be Count Malvolio
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe
Seven of my people with an obedient start make out for him
I frown the while and perchance wind up watch or play with mysome rich jewel
Lips do not move No man must know
No man must know What follows
No man must know If this should be thee Malvolio
I may command where I adore But silence like a Lucrece knife With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore MOAI
doth sway my life Nay but first let me see let me see let me see
I may command where I adore Why she may command me
Why this is evident to any formal capacity
There is no obstruction in this
If I could make that resemble something in meSoftly
There is a fair behavior in thee captain And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character
I pritheeand Ill pay thee bounteously Conceal me what I am and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent
Ill serve this duke
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him
It may be worth thy pains for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service
Be you his eunuch and your mute Ill be
When my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see
I thank thee
Lead me on
MMalvolio
Mwhy that begins my name
MOAI This simulation is not as the former and yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for every one of these letters are in my name
Soft here follows prose
If this fall into thy hand revolve
In my stars I am above thee but be not afraid of greatness
Some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon em
Thy Fates open their hands
Let thy blood and spirit embrace them
And to inure thyself to what thou art like to be cast thy humble slough and appear fresh
I say remember
Farewell
She that would alter services with thee  The Fortunate Unhappy  Daylight and champaign discovers not more
This is open
I will be proud I will read politic authors I will baffle Sir Toby I will wash off gross acquaintance I will be point devise the very man
I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me for every reason excites to this that my lady loves me
She did commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being crossgartered and in this she manifests herself to my love and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking
I thank my stars I am happy
I will be strange stout in yellow stockings and crossgartered even with the swiftness of putting on
Jove and my stars be praised
Here is yet a postscript
Thou canst not choose but know who I am
If thou entertainest my love let it appear in thy smiling
Thy smiles become thee well
Therefore in my presence still smile dear my sweet I prithee 
Jove I thank thee
I will do everything that thou wilt have me
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy
I could marry this wench for this device
So could I too
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest
Nor I neither
Here comes my noble gullcatcher
Wilt thou set thy foot o my neck
Or o mine either
Shall I play my freedom at traytrip and become thy bondslave
I faith or I either
Why thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad 
Nay but say true does it work upon him
Like aqua vitae with a midwife
If you will see it follow me
To the gates of Tartar thou most excellent devil of wit
Ill make one too
Save thee friend and thy music
Dost thou live by thy tabour
No sir I live by the church
Art thou a churchman
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy tabor if thy tabor stand by the church
You have said sir
How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward
Nay thats certain
I would therefore my sister had no name sir
Why man
Why sir her names a word and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton
Thy reason man
Troth sir I can yield you none without words and words are grown so false I am loath to prove reason with them
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing
Not so sir I do care for something
But in my conscience sir I do not care for you
If that be to care for nothing sir I would it would make you invisible
Art not thou the Lady Olivias fool
No indeed sir the Lady Olivia has no folly
I saw thee late at the Count Orsinos
It shines everywhere
I would be sorry sir but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress I think I saw your wisdom there
Hold theres expenses for thee
Now Jove in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard
to fool Is thy lady within
Yes being kept together and put to use
My lady is within sir
I will construe to them whence you come
Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin I might say element but the word is overworn 
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool And to do that well craves a kind of wit
This is a practise As full of labor as a wise mans art For folly that he wisely shows is fit
Save you gentleman
And you sir
I am bound to your niece sir
I mean she is the list of my voyage
Taste your legs sir
Put them to motion
I mean to go sir to enter
I will answer you with gait and entrance
But we are prevented
Most excellent accomplished lady the heavens rain odors on you
My matter hath no voice lady but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear
em all three all ready
Let the garden door be shut and leave me to my hearing
Give me your hand sir
My duty madam and most humble service
What is your name
Cesario is your servants name fair princess
My servant sir
Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was calld compliment
For him I think not on him
For his thoughts Would they were blanks rather than filld with me
Madam I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf
O by your leave I pray you I bade you never speak again of him
Dear lady Give me leave beseech you
I did send After the last enchantment you did here A ring in chase of you
What might you think
What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus
By my troth Sir Toby you must come in earlier o nights
Your cousin my lady takes great exceptions to your ill hours
Why let her except before excepted
Ill confine myself no finer than I am
These clothes are good enough to drink in and so be these boots too
An they be not let them hang themselves in their own straps
Who Sir Andrew Aguecheek
Ay he
Hes as tall a man as any s in Illyria
Have you not set mine honor at the stake And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think
To one of your receiving Enough is shown
So let me hear you speak
I pity you
Thats a degree to love
No not a grize
If one should be a prey how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf
There lies your way due west
Stay I prithee tell me what thou thinkest of me
That you do think you are not what you are
If I think so I think the same of you
I would you were as I would have you be
Would it be better madam than I am
I wish it might for now I am your fool
And so adieu good madam
No faith Ill not stay a jot longer
Thy reason dear venom give thy reason
You must needs yield your reason Sir Andrew
Marry I saw your niece do more favors to the Counts servingman than ever she bestowed upon me
I saw t i the orchard
Did she see thee the while old boy
Tell me that
As plain as I see you now
This was a great argument of love in her toward you
Slight will you make an ass o me
I will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of judgment and reason
And they have been grandjurymen since before Noah was a sailor
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valor to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver
You should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests firenew from the mint you should have banged the youth into dumbness 
This was looked for at your hand and this was balked
An t be any way it must be with valor for policy I hate
I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician
Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor
Challenge me the counts youth to fight with him
Hurt him in eleven places
My niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no lovebroker in the world can more prevail in mans commendation with woman than report of valor
There is no way but this Sir Andrew
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him
Go write it in a martial hand
Be curst and brief
It is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and full of invention
Go
This is a dear manikin to you Sir Toby
I have been dear to him lad some two thousand strong or so
We shall have a rare letter from him but youll not deliver t
Never trust me then
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer
I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes
If you desire the spleen and will laugh yourself into stitches follow me
Hes in yellow stockings 
And crossgartered
Most villanously like a pedant that keeps a school i the church
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies
You have not seen such a thing as tis
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him
I know my lady will strike him
If she do hell smile and take t for a great favor
Come bring us bring us where he is
I could not stay behind you
My kind Antonio I can no other answer make but thanks And thanks and ever thanks
Whats to do
Shall we go see the relics of this town
Belike you slew great number of his people
It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them which for traffics sake Most of our city did
Only myself stood out For which if I be lapsèd in this place I shall pay dear
Do not then walk too open
It doth not fit me
Hold sir heres my purse
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase and your store I think is not for idle markets sir
Ill be your pursebearer and leave you For an hour
To the Elephant
I do remember
I have sent after him
He says hell come
For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrowd
I speak too loud Wheres Malvolio
He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes
Where is Malvolio
Hes coming madam but in very strange manner
He is sure possessed madam
Why whats the matter
Does he rave
No madam he does nothing but smile
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come for sure the man is tainted in s wits
Go call him hither
I am as mad as he If sad and merry madness equal be
How now Malvolio
Sweet lady ho ho
Why he has three thousand ducats a year
Hes a very fool and a prodigal
Fie that youll say so
By this hand they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him
Who are they
They that add moreover hes drunk nightly in your company
With drinking healths to my niece
Ill drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria
Hes a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o th toe like a parish top
Sir Toby Belch
How now Sir Toby Belch
Sweet Sir Andrew
Smilest thou
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion
Sad lady
I could be sad
This does make some obstruction in the blood this crossgartering but what of that
If it please the eye of one it is with me as the very true sonnet is Please one and please all  Why how dost thou man
What is the matter with thee
Not black in my mind though yellow in my legs
It did come to his hands and commands shall be executed
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand
Wilt thou go to bed Malvolio
To bed
How do you Malvolio
At your request
Yes nightingales answer daws
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady
Be not afraid of greatness Twas well writ
What meanest thou by that Malvolio
Some are born great
Ha
Some achieve greatness What sayest thou
And some have greatness thrust upon them Heaven restore thee
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings Thy yellow stockings
And wished to see thee crossgartered Crossgartered
Go to thou art made if thou desirest to be so Am I made
Madam the young gentleman of the Count Orsinos is returned
Ill come to him
Good Maria let this fellow be looked to
Wheres my cousin Toby
Let some of my people have a special care of him
I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry
Oh ho
Do you come near me now
This concurs directly with the letter
Cast thy humble slough says she
I have limed her but it is Joves doing and Jove make me thankful
And when she went away now Let this fellow be looked to Fellow Not Malvolio nor after my degree but fellow Why everything adheres together that no dram of a scruple no scruple of a scruple no obstacle no incredulous or unsafe circumstancewhat can be said
Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes
Well Jove not I is the doer of this and he is to be thanked 
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little and Legion himself possessed him yet Ill speak to him
Here he is here he is
How ist with you sir
Go off I discard you
Let me enjoy my private
Go off
Aha
Does she so
Do you know what you say
Marry and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live
My lady would not lose him for more than Ill say
How now mistress
O Lord
No way but gentleness gently gently
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used
Sir
Ay Biddy come with meWhat man
Tis not for gravity to play at cherrypit with Satan
Hang him foul collier
Get him to say his prayers good Sir Toby get him to pray
My prayers minx
Go hang yourselves all
You are idle shallow things
I am not of your element
You shall know more hereafter 
Is t possible
If this were played upon a stage now I could condemn it as an improbable fiction
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device man
Nay pursue him now lest the device take air and taint
Why we shall make him mad indeed
The house will be the quieter
Come well have him in a dark room and bound
My niece is already in the belief that hes mad
More matter for a May morning
Is t so saucy
Ay is t I warrant him
Do but read
Give me
A good note that keeps you from the blow of the law
Very brief and to exceeding good senseless
Good
Still you keep o the windy side of the law
Good
Andrew Aguecheek 
If this letter move him not his legs cannot
Ill give t him
You may have very fit occasion for t
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart
Go Sir Andrew
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bumbaily
Away
Nay let me alone for swearing
His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less
Therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in the youth
He will find it comes from a clodpole
But sir I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor and drive the gentleman as I know his youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity
This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look like cockatrices 
Here he comes with your niece
Give them way till he take leave and presently after him
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge
With the same havior that your passion bears Goes on my masters grief
Here wear this jewel for me
Tis my picture
Refuse it not
It hath no tongue to vex you
And I beseech you come again tomorrow
What shall you ask of me that Ill deny That honor saved may upon asking give
Nothing but this your true love for my master
How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you
I will acquit you
Well come again tomorrow
Fare thee well
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell
Gentleman God save thee
And you sir
That defense thou hast betake thee to t
Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him I know not but thy intercepter full of despite bloody as the hunter attends thee at the orchard end
Dismount thy tuck be yare in thy preparation for thy assailant is quick skillful and deadly
You mistake sir
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me
My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man
Youll find it otherwise I assure you
I pray you sir what is he
He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private brawl
Souls and bodies hath he divorced three and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre
Hob nob is his word
And you too sir
Accost Sir Andrew accost
Whats that
Good Mistress Accost I desire better acquaintance
My name is Mary sir
By my troth I would not undertake her in this company
Is that the meaning of accost
An thou let part so Sir Andrew would thou mightst never draw sword again
An you part so mistress I would I might never draw sword again
Fair lady do you think you have fools in hand
Sir I have not you by the hand
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady
I am no fighter
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valor
Belike this is a man of that quirk
Sir no
His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury
Therefore get you on and give him his desire
Back you shall not to the house unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him
This is as uncivil as strange
I beseech you do me this courteous office as to know of the knight what my offense to him is
It is something of my negligence nothing of my purpose
I will do so
Signior Fabian stay you by this gentleman till my return
Pray you sir do you know of this matter
I beseech you what manner of man is he
He is indeed sir the most skillful bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria
Will you walk towards him
I will make your peace with him if I can 
I shall be much bound to you for t
Why man hes a very devil
I have not seen such a firago
I had a pass with him rapier scabbard and all and he gives me the stuckin with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable
And on the answer he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy
Pox on t
Ill not meddle with him
Ay but he will not now be pacified
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder
Plague on t an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence Id have seen him damned ere Id have challenged him
Let him let the matter slip and Ill give him my horse gray Capilet
Ill make the motion
Stand here make a good show on t
This shall end without the perdition of souls
Ill ride your horse as well as I ride you
He is as horribly conceited of him and pants and looks pale as if a bear were at his heels
Come Sir Andrew theres no remedy
The gentleman will for his honors sake have one bout with you
He cannot by the duello avoid it
But he has promised me as he is a gentleman and a soldier he will not hurt you
Come on to t
Pray God he keep his oath
I do assure you tis against my will
Put up your sword
If this young gentleman Have done offence I take the fault on me
If you offend him I for him defy you
You sir
Why what are you
One sir that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will
Nay if you be an undertaker I am for you
O good Sir Toby hold
Here come the officers
Marry will I sir
And for that I promised you Ill be as good as my word
He will bear you easily and reins well
This is the man
Do thy office
Antonio I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino
You do mistake me sir
No sir no jot
I know your favor well Though now you have no seacap on your head Take him away
He knows I know him well
I must obey
You stand amazed But be of comfort
Come sir away
What money sir
Ill make division of my present with you
Hold theres half my coffer
Will you deny me now
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying vainness babbling drunkenness Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood    O heavens themselves
Come sir I pray you go
Let me speak a little
Away
But oh how vile an idol proves this god
None can be called deformed but the unkind
Virtue is beauty but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks oerflourished by the devil
The man grows mad
Away with him
Lead me on
Methinks his words do from such passion fly That he believes himself
So do not I
Prove true imagination oh prove true That I dear brother be now taen for you
Come hither knight
Come hither Fabian
Well whisper oer a couplet or two of most sage saws
He named Sebastian
Still in this fashion color ornament For him I imitate
Oh if it prove Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love
A very dishonest paltry boy and more a coward than a hare
His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him
And for his cowardship ask Fabian
A coward a most devout coward religious in it
Slid Ill after him again and beat him
An I do not Come lets see the event
I dare lay any money twill be nothing yet
Let me be clear of thee
Well held out i faith
No I do not know you nor I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come speak with her nor your name is not Master Cesario nor this is not my nose neither
Nothing that is so is so
I prithee vent thy folly somewhere else
Thou knowst not me
Vent my folly
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool
Vent my folly
I am afraid this great lubber the world will prove a cockney
I prithee now ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady
Shall I vent to her that thou art coming
I prithee foolish Greek depart from me
Theres money for thee
By my troth thou hast an open hand
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good reportafter fourteen years purchase 
Hold sir or Ill throw your dagger oer the house
Nay let him alone
Ill go another way to work with him
Ill have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria
Though I struck him first yet its no matter for that
Come sir I will not let you go
Come my young soldier put up your iron
You are well fleshed
Come on
I will be free from thee
What wouldst thou now
If thou darest tempt me further draw thy sword
What what
Nay then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you
Hold Toby
On thy life I charge thee hold
Madam
Will it be ever thus
Out of my sight Be not offended dear Cesario Rudesby be gone
Thou shalt not choose but go
Do not deny
Beshrew his soul for me
He started one poor heart of mine in thee
Wherefore sweetheart
Why I think so
I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry
But whats your jest
A dry jest sir
Are you full of them
Marry now I let go your hand I am barren
O knight thou lackest a cup of canary
When did I see thee so put down
Never in your life I think unless you see canary put me down
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has
If it be thus to dream still let me sleep
Nay come I prithee
Would thoudst be ruled by me
Madam I will
Oh say so and so be
Nay I prithee put on this gown and this beard
Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate
Do it quickly
Ill call Sir Toby the whilst
The competitors enter
Jove bless thee master Parson
Bonos dies Sir Toby
To him Sir Topas
The knave counterfeits well
A good knave
Sir Topas Sir Topas good Sir Topas go to my lady Out hyperbolical fiend
How vexest thou this man
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies
Fie thou dishonest Satan
I call thee by the most modest terms for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy
Sayest thou that house is dark
As hell Sir Topas
Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes and the clerestories toward the southnorth are as lustrous as ebony
And yet complainest thou of obstruction
I am not mad Sir Topas
I say to you this house is dark
Madman thou errest
I say there is no darkness but ignorance in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog
I say this house is as dark as ignorance though ignorance were as dark as hell
I am no more mad than you are
Make the trial of it in any constant question
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird
What thinkest thou of his opinion
I think nobly of the soul and no way approve his opinion
Fare thee well
Remain thou still in darkness
Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam
Fare thee well
Sir Topas Sir Topas
My most exquisite Sir Topas
Nay I am for all waters
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown
He sees thee not
To him in thine own voice and bring me word how thou findest him
I would we were well rid of this knavery
If he may be conveniently delivered I would he were for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot
Come by and by to my chamber
Fool
Fool
Fool I say
Good fool as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand help me to a candle and pen ink and paper
As I am a gentleman I will live to be thankful to thee for t
Master Malvolio
Ay good fool
But as well
Then you are mad indeed if you be no better in your wits than a fool
Sir Topas
Fool fool fool I say
Alas sir be patient
What say you sir
Good fool help me to some light and some paper
I tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria
Welladay that you were sir
By this hand I am
Good fool some ink paper and light and convey what I will set down to my lady
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did
I will help you to t
But tell me true are you not mad indeed
Or do you but counterfeit
Believe me I am not
I tell thee true
Nay Ill neer believe a madman till I see his brains
I will fetch you light and paper and ink
Fool Ill requite it in the highest degree
I prithee be gone                          
This is the air that is the glorious sun
Wheres Antonio then
I could not find him at the Elephant
Yet there he was and there I found this credit That he did range the town to seek me out
His counsel now might do me golden service
Theres something in t That is deceivable
But here the lady comes
Ill follow this good man and go with you And having sworn truth ever will be true
Then lead the way good father and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine
Now as thou lovest me let me see his letter
Good Master Fabian grant me another request
Anything
Do not desire to see this letter
Belong you to the Lady Olivia friends
Ay sir we are some of her trappings
I know thee well
How dost thou my good fellow
Truly sir the better for my foes and the worse for my friends
The better for thy friends
No sir the worse
How can that be
Ill ride home tomorrow Sir Toby
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair
Why would that have mended my hair
Past question for thou seest it will not curl by nature
But it becomes me well enough does t not
Excellent
It hangs like flax on a distaff
Faith Ill home tomorrow Sir Toby
The count himself here hard by woos her
I have heard her swear t
Tut theres life in t man 
Marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass
So that by my foes sir I profit in the knowledge of myself and by my friends I am abused
So that conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives make your two affirmatives why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes
Why this is excellent
By my troth sir nothough it please you to be one of my friends
Thou shalt not be the worse for me theres gold
But that it would be doubledealing sir I would you could make it another
O you give me ill counsel
Well I will be so much a sinner to be a doubledealer
Theres another
Primo secundo tertio is a good play and the old saying is the third pays for all
The triplex sir is a good tripping measure or the bells of Saint Bennet sir may put you in mindone two three 
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her and bring her along with you it may awake my bounty further
Marry sir lullaby to your bounty till I come again
I go sir but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness
But as you say sir let your bounty take a nap I will awake it anon
Here comes the man sir that did rescue me
That face of his I do remember well
Yet when I saw it last it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war
A baubling vessel was he captain of For shallow draught and bulk unprizable With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on himWhats the matter
Orsino this is that Antonio That took the  And this is he that did the  When your young nephew Titus lost his leg
He did me kindness sir drew on my side But in conclusion put strange speech upon me
I know not what twas but distraction
Notable pirate
Orsino noble sir Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate Though I confess on base and ground enough Orsinos enemy
That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude seas enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem
A wreck past hope he was
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love without retention or restraint All his in dedication
How can this be  
Here comes the Countess
Now heaven walks on earth
What would my lord but that he may not have Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable
Cesario you do not keep promise with me
Madam
Gracious Olivia What do you say CesarioGood my lord My lord would speak
My duty hushes me
Still so cruel
Still so constant lord
What to perverseness
You uncivil lady To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfullst offrings have breathed out That eer devotion tenderedwhat shall I do
Even what it please my lord that shall become him
Come boy with me
And I most jocund apt and willingly To do you rest a thousand deaths would die
Where goes Cesario
Ay me detested
Who does beguile you
Who does do you wrong
Hast thou forgot thyself
Is it so long Call forth the holy father
Come away
Whither my lordCesario husband stay
Husband
Ay husband
Can he that deny
Her husband sirrah
No my lord not I Alas it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety
Fear not Cesario
Be that thou knowst thou art and then thou art As great as that thou fearst
O welcome father
Father I charge thee by thy reverence Here to unfold though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before tis ripe what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me
My lord I do protest    O do not swear
Hold little faith though thou hast too much fear
For the love of God a surgeon
Send one presently to Sir Toby
Whats the matter
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too
For the love of God your help
I had rather than forty pound I were at home
Who has done this Sir Andrew
The Counts gentleman one Cesario
We took him for a coward but hes the very devil incardinate
My gentleman Cesario
Ods lifelings here he isYou broke my head for nothing and that that I did I was set on to do t by Sir Toby
Why do you speak to me
I never hurt you
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt you have hurt me
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb
Here comes Sir Toby halting
You shall hear more
But if he had not been in drink he would have tickled you othergates than he did
How now gentleman
How is t with you
Thats all one has hurt me and theres the end on t
FOOL Oh hes drunk Sir Toby an hour agone
His eyes were set at eight i the morning
Then hes a rogue and a passymeasures pavin
I hate a drunken rogue 
Away with him
Who hath made this havoc with them
Ill help you Sir Toby because well be dressed together
Will you helpAn asshead and a coxcomb and a knave a thinfaced knave a gull
Get him to bed and let his hurt be looked to
Pardon me sweet one even for the vows We made each other but so late ago
One face one voice one habit and two persons
Antonio O my dear Antonio
How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee
Sebastian are you
Fearst thou that Antonio
How have you made division of yourself
An apple cleft in two is not more twin Than these two creatures
Which is Sebastian
Most wonderful
Sebastian was my father Such a Sebastian was my brother too So went he suited to his watery tomb
A spirit I am indeed But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate
Were you a woman as the rest goes even I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say Thricewelcome drownèd Viola My father had a mole upon his brow
And so had mine
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years
Ill stay a month longer
I am a fellow o th strangest mind i th world
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether
Art thou good at these kickshawses knight
Wherefore are these things hid
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before em
Are they like to take dust like Mistress Malls picture
Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto
I would not so much as make water but in a sinkapace
What dost thou mean
Is it a world to hide virtues in
I did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg it was formed under the star of a galliard
Ay tis strong and it does indifferent well in a duncolored stock
What shall we do else
Were we not born under Taurus
Oh that record is lively in my soul
He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years
Give me thy hand And let me see thee in thy womans weeds
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maids garments
He upon some action Is now in durance at Malvolios suit A gentleman and follower of my ladys
He shall enlarge him
A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his
Truly madam he holds Beelzebub at the staves end as well as a man in his case may do
Has here writ a letter to you
I should have given t you today morning but as a madmans epistles are no gospels so it skills not much when they are delivered
Open t and read it
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman
How now
Art thou mad
No madam I do but read madness
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be you must allow  Prithee read i thy right wits
So I do madonna
But to read his right wits is to read thus
Therefore perpend my princess and give ear
By the Lord madam you wrong me and the world shall know it
Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship
Think of me as you please
I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury
The madly used Malvolio  Did he write this
Ay madam
This savors not much of distraction
See him delivered Fabian bring him hither
Madam I am most apt to embrace your offer
Is this the madman
Ay my lord this same
How now Malvolio
Madam you have done me wrong Notorious wrong
Have I Malvolio
No
Tell me why
Alas Malvolio this is not my writing Though I confess much like the character
But out of question tis Marias hand
And now I do bethink me it was she First told me thou wast mad then camest in smiling And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter
Prithee be content
Why some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrown upon them I was one sir in this interlude one Sir Topas sir but thats all one
He hath been most notoriously abused
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace
He hath not told us of the captain yet
Cesario come For so you shall be while you are a man
Taurus
Thats sides and heart
No sir it is legs and thighs
Let me see the caper
He hath known you but three days and already you are no stranger
No believe me
I thank you
Here comes the count
Who saw Cesario ho
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds Rather than make unprofited return
I think not so my lord
Dear lad believe it
For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man
I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair
Ill do my best To woo your lady Whoeer I woo myself would be his wife
Give me excess of it that surfeiting The appetite may sicken and so die
Oh it came oer my ear like the sweet sound That breathes upon a bank of violets Stealing and giving odor
Tis not so sweet now as it was before
So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical
Will you go hunt my lord
What Curio
My lady will hang thee for thy absence
Let her hang me
Make that good
He shall see none to fear
A good lenten answer
I can tell thee where that saying was born of I fear no colors  Where good Mistress Mary
In the wars
Well God give them wisdom that have it
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent
You are resolute then
Well go thy way
If Sir Toby would leave drinking thou wert as witty a piece of Eves flesh as any in Illyria
Peace you rogue no more o that
Here comes my lady
Take the fool away
Do you not hear fellows
Take away the lady
Go to youre a dry fool
Ill no more of you
Besides you grow dishonest
If he cannot let the botcher mend him
Anything thats mended is but patched
Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin and sin that amends is but patched with virtue
If that this simple syllogism will serve so
If it will not what remedy
Sir I bade them take away you
Good madonna give me leave to prove you a fool
Can you do it
Dexterously good madonna
I must catechise you for it madonna
Good my mouse of virtue answer me
Well sir for want of other idleness Ill bide your proof
Good madonna why mournest thou
Good fool for my brothers death
I think his soul is in hell madonna
I know his soul is in heaven fool
The more fool madonna to mourn for your brothers soul being in heaven
Take away the fool gentlemen
What think you of this fool Malvolio
Doth he not mend
Yes and shall do till the pangs of death shake him
Infirmity that decays the wise doth ever make the better fool
God send you sir a speedy infirmity for the better increasing your folly
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool
How say you to that Malvolio
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools zanies
Oh you are sick of selflove Malvolio and taste with a distempered appetite
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing for thou speakest well of fools
Madam there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you
From the Count Orsino is it
I know not madam
Tis a fair young man and well attended
Who of my people hold him in delay
Sir Toby madam your kinsman
He speaks nothing but madman
If it be a suit from the count I am sick or not at home
What is he at the gate cousin
A gentleman
A gentleman
What gentleman
Good Sir Toby
Lechery
I defy lechery
Theres one at the gate
Ay marry what is he
Let him be the devil an he will I care not
Give me faith say I
Whats a drunken man like fool
Like a drowned man a fool and a madman
One draught above heat makes him a fool the second mads him and a third drowns him
Go look after him
Madam yond young fellow swears he will speak with you
I told him you were sick
He takes on him to understand so much and therefore comes to speak with you
I told him you were asleep
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too and therefore comes to speak with you
What is to be said to him lady
Hes fortified against any denial 
Tell him he shall not speak with me
What manner of man
Of very ill manner
Hell speak with you will you or no
Of what personage and years is he
Not yet old enough for a man nor young enough for a boy as a squash is before tis a peascod or a codling when tis almost an apple
Tis with him in standing water between boy and man
He is very wellfavored and he speaks very shrewishly
One would think his mothers milk were scarce out of him
Let him approach
Call in my gentlewoman
Gentlewoman my lady calls
Give me my veil
Come throw it oer my face 
The honorable lady of the house which is she
Speak to me
I shall answer for her
Your will
Most radiant exquisite and unmatchable beautyI pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house for I never saw her
I would be loath to cast away my speech for besides that it is excellently well penned I have taken great pains to con it
Good beauties let me sustain no scorn
I am very comptible even to the least sinister usage
Whence came you sir
I can say little more than I have studied and that questions out of my part
Good gentle one give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house that I may proceed in my speech
Are you a comedian
No my profound heart
And yet by the very fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play
Are you the lady of the house
If I do not usurp myself I am
Most certain if you are she you do usurp yourself for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve
But this is from my commission
I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message 
Come to what is important in t
I forgive you the praise
Alas I took great pains to study it and tis poetical
It is the more like to be feigned
I pray you keep it in
If you be not mad be gone
Will you hoist sail sir
Here lies your way
Tell me your mind
Speak your office
It alone concerns your ear
I bring no overture of war no taxation of homage
My words are as full of peace as matter
Yet you began rudely
What are you
What would you
How now
What news from her
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead
Give us the place alone
Most sweet lady A comfortable doctrine and much may be said of it
Where lies your text
In Orsinos bosom
In his bosom
In what chapter of his bosom
To answer by the method in the first of his heart
Oh I have read it
It is heresy
Have you no more to say
Good madam let me see your face
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face
You are now out of your text
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture
Look you sir such a one I was this present
Is t not well done 
Twill endure wind and weather
O sir I will not be so hardhearted
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty
But if you were the devil you are fair
My lord and master loves you
How does he love me
Your lord does know my mind
I cannot love him
Yet I suppose him virtuous know him noble Of great estate of fresh and stainless youth
In voices well divulged free learned and valiant And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person
But yet I cannot love him He might have took his answer long ago
Why what would you
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house
Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night
You might do much
Above my fortunes yet my state is well
I am a gentleman
Get you to your lord
I cannot love him
Let him send no more Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it
Fare you well
I thank you for your pains
Spend this for me
I am no feed post lady
Keep your purse
My master not myself lacks recompense
Farewell fair cruelty
What is your parentage Above my fortunes yet my state is well
Not too fast
Soft soft
Unless the master were the man
How now
Even so quickly may one catch the plague
Well let it be What ho Malvolio
Here madam at your service
Run after that same peevish messenger The countys man
He left this ring behind him Would I or not
Madam I will
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind
Fate show thy force
Ourselves we do not owe
What is decreed must be and be this so
By your patience no
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound
No sooth sir
My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy
But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in
He left behind him myself and a sister both born in an hour
If the heavens had been pleased would we had so ended
But you sir altered that for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned
Alas the day
A lady sir though it was said she much resembled me was yet of many accounted beautiful
She is drowned already sir with salt water though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more
O good Antonio forgive me your trouble
If you will not murder me for my love let me be your servant
Fare you well at once
I am bound to the Count Orsinos court
Farewell
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee
I have many enemies in Orsinos court Else would I very shortly see thee there
But come what may I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport and I will go
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia
Even now sir
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither
She returns this ring to you sir
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself
Receive it so
She took the ring of me
Ill none of it
Come sir you peevishly threw it to her and her will is it should be so returned
I left no ring with her
What means this lady
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her
She made good view of me indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue For she did speak in starts distractedly
She loves me sure
The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger
I am the man
If it be so as tis Poor lady she were better love a dream
How will this fadge
What will become of this
O time thou must untangle this not I
It is too hard a knot for me to untie
Approach Sir Andrew
Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes and  Nay my troth I know not
But I know to be up late is to be up late
A false conclusion
I hate it as an unfilled can
Thourt a scholar
Let us therefore eat and drink
Marian I say
A stoup of wine
Here comes the fool i faith
How now my hearts
Did you never see the picture of We Three
Welcome ass
Now lets have a catch
What country friends is this
This is Illyria lady
And what should I do in Illyria
My brother he is in Elysium
Perchance he is not drowndWhat think you sailors
It is perchance that you yourself were saved
O my poor brother
And so perchance may he be
True madam
Knowst thou this country
Ay madam well for I was bred and born Not three hours travel from this very place
By my troth the fool has an excellent breast
My lady has a white hand and the Myrmidons are no bottleale houses
If one knight give a Would you have a love song or a song of good life
A love song a love song
Ay ay
I care not for good life              
Excellent good i faith
Good good
A mellifluous voice as I am true knight
A contagious breath
Very sweet and contagious i faith
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver
Shall we do that
An you love me lets do t
Most certain
Let our catch be Thou Knave Hold thy peace thou knave knight
I shall be constrained in t to call thee knave knight 
It begins Hold thy peace I shall never begin if I hold my peace
Good i faith
Come begin
What a caterwauling do you keep here
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors never trust me
For the love o God peace
My masters are you mad
Or what are you
Have you no wit manners nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night
Is there no respect of place persons nor time in you
We did keep time sir in our catches
Sneck up
Sir Toby I must be round with you
My lady bade me tell you that though she harbors you as her kinsman shes nothing allied to your disorders
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors you are welcome to the house
If not an it would please you to take leave of her she is very willing to bid you farewell
Nay good Sir Toby
Out o tune sir
You lie
Yes by Saint Anne and ginger shall be hot i the mouth too
Thourt i the right
Go shake your ears
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a mans ahungry to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him
Do t knight
Ill write thee a challenge
Or Ill deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth 
Sweet Sir Toby be patient for tonight
Since the youth of the counts was today with thy lady she is much out of quiet
For Monsieur Malvolio let me alone with him
I know I can do it
O if I thought that Id beat him like a dog
I have no exquisite reason for t but I have reason good enough
And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work
What wilt thou do
I can write very like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands
Excellent
I have t in my nose too
He shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop that they come from my niece and that shes in love with him
My purpose is indeed a horse of that color
And your horse now would make him an ass
Ass I doubt not
Oh twill be admirable
Sport royal I warrant you
I know my physic will work with him
I will plant you two and let the fool make a third where he shall find the letter
Observe his construction of it
For this night to bed and dream on the event
Farewell
Good night Penthesilea
Before me shes a good wench
Shes a beagle truebred and one that adores me
What o that
I was adored once too
Lets to bed knight
Thou hadst need send for more money
If thou hast her not i the end call me Cut  If I do not never trust me take it how you will
Tis too late to go to bed now
Give me some music
He is not here so please your lordship that should sing it
Who was it
He is about the house
Thou dost speak masterly
My life upon t young though thou art thine eye Hath stayd upon some favor that it loves
Hath it not boy
A little by your favor
What kind of woman ist
Of your complexion
She is not worth thee then
What years i faith
About your years my lord
Too old by heaven
Let still the woman take An elder than herself
I think it well my lord
Then let thy love be younger than thyself Or thy affection cannot hold the bent
For women are as roses whose fair flower Being once displayed doth fall that very hour
And so they are
Alas that they are so To die even when they to perfection grow
Who governs here
A noble duke in nature As in name
What is his name
Orsino
Orsino
I have heard my father name him
He was a bachelor then
For but a month ago I went from hence And then twas fresh in murmuras you know What great ones do the less will prattle of That he did seek the love of fair Olivia
Whats she
Oh that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world Till I had made mine own occasion mellow What my estate is
Are you ready sir
No pains sir
I take pleasure in singing sir
Ill pay thy pleasure then
Give me now leave to leave thee
Farewell
Let all the rest give place
Once more Cesario Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
Tell her my love more noble than the world Prizes not quantity of dirty lands The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her Tell her I hold as giddily as fortune But tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul
But if she cannot love you sir
I cannot be so answerd
Sooth but you must
Say that some lady as perhaps there is Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia
Must she not then be answered
There is no womans sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart
No womans heart So big to hold so much
They lack retention
Alas their love may be called appetite No motion of the liver but the palate That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt But mine is all as hungry as the sea And can digest as much
Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia
Ay but I know What dost thou know
Too well what love women to men may owe
In faith they are as true of heart as we
My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be perhaps were I a woman I should your lordship
And whats her history
A blank my lord
Was not this love indeed
But died thy sister of her love my boy
I am all the daughters of my fathers house And all the brothers tooand yet I know not
Sir shall I to this lady
Come thy ways Signior Fabian
Nay Ill come
If I lose a scruple of this sport let me be boiled to death with melancholy
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheepbiter come by some notable shame
I would exult man
You know he brought me out o favor with my lady about a bearbaiting here
To anger him well have the bear again and we will fool him black and blue
Shall we not Sir Andrew
An we do not it is pity of our lives
Here comes the little villain
How now my metal of India
Get you all three into the boxtree
Malvolios coming down this walk
He has been yonder i the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour
Observe him for the love of mockery for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him
