What an idiot this guy isYoure a rotten piece of workI beg your highness beat him up and take his wine bottle from him
When he loses that hell be drinking salt water since Ill never tell him where the freshwater springs are
Trinculo watch out
If you interrupt this monster with one more word Ill beat you like a piece of salted fish
What did I do
I didnt do anything
I need to get away from you
Didnt you call him a liar
You lie
I didnt accuse you of lying
Are you out of your mind and deaf too
Damn your wine
Ha ha ha
Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your storyPlease go stand farther away
Beat him up
After a little while Ill beat him too
Just as I told you he usually sleeps in the afternoon
At that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books or you can bash his skull with a log or you can stab him in the belly or cut his windpipe
Just remember to grab his books first since without them hes just a poor fool like me and cant command a single spirit
All the spirits hate him as much as I do
Be sure to burn his magic books
He has some wonderful home furnishingsthats what he calls themthat hell use to decorate his house when he gets one
The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is
He says she has no equal
I never saw a woman except her and Sycorax my mother
But Miranda is so much more beautiful you cant even compare the two
Is she really that wonderful
Yes my lord
Monster Ill kill this man
His daughter and I will be king and queenGod protect usand you and Trinculo will be our governorsDo you like that idea Trinculo
Excellent
Give me your hand
Im sorry I hit you
But try to control your speech
In a half an hour hell be asleep
Will you kill him then
Dear father if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers please put an end to it
The skys so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea werent swelling up to the sky to put its fire out
Oh I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer
A fine ship with some good people in it Im sure smashed to pieces
Their dying shouts broke my heart
The poor people died
If Id been a god I wouldve let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying
Calm down
Theres nothing to get upset about
No harm was done
Oh what a horrible day
There was no harm Im telling you
It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know
Yes I swear
You make me so happy
Im full of joy
Lets be lighthearted
Ill do anything you ask monster anything reasonableCome on Trinculo lets sing
Thats not the tune I had in mind
Whats this song
Oh forgive all my sins
Are you scared
No monster not me
Dont be scared
Thisll be a wonderful kingdom to live in where they play music for free
As soon as you kill Prospero
Thatll happen soon enough
I remember the plan
The sound is going away
But lets follow it and then do our dirty work afterward
Lead us monster well follow
I wish I could see this invisible drummer
He really plays well
Are you coming monster
My old bones are tired
Were wandering in a maze
If you dont mind I need to rest a bit
I cant blame you old lord
Sit down and rest
Were searching on land but hes lost in the sea
We have to give up and let him go      
Whats that music
My friends listen
What marvelous music
Heaven help us
What were those things
Now Ill believe that unicorns exist and that theres a tree in Arabia where the phoenix lives
Travelers have never told lies no matter what the fools at home accuse them of
If I told them about this back in Naples would they believe me
Id tell them that I saw natives like thesesince they must be nativeswho are graceful and wellmannered even if theyre monstrous to look at kinder than most human beings you might find kinder than almost any human  
They vanished strangely
Its all right since they left their food behind and were hungry
Would you like to taste the banquet
Not me
I assure you sir theres nothing to be afraid of
Brother Duke please have some food
Oh its horrible horrible
I thought the clouds were talking to me the winds were singing to me and the thunder like an awful organ pipe roared Prosperos name
It sang about my crimes
Ill go join him there going down deeper than any anchor ever sank and lie with him dead in the mud
Ill fight every one of these devils if I have to one at a time
Ill back you up
All three of them are crazy with despair
Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them like a slowacting poison
Those of you who are young and active I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do
Follow them please
But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place the heavens will not bless your relationship but will overwhelm you with hate contempt and discord and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it
Youve said it well
So have a seat and talk to her
Shes yoursCome Ariel
My trusty servant Ariel
What does my powerful master wish for
Im here
You and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well and now I need your help again
Go bring them all here I give you power over them
Ive promised them I would and theyre expecting it
Right now
Yes right away
Before you can say Come and Go And breathe twice and shout So so Each one of your servants will rush here
Its time for you to know the whole story
Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak
Not yet Well the time has come
Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack
I doubt it since you werent even three at the time
Sure I can father
What do you remember
A house a person
Tell me anything you remember
I love you dearly Ariel
Dont come near till you hear me call you
All right I understand
I assure you sir the tender love I feel in my heart is stronger than the sexual passions stirring down below
GoodNow come Ariel
Better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed
Appear before me now quickly No talking
Just watch
Be quiet
I have come to announce that Juno has asked you Ceres goddess of the fields and the earth to leave your rich farms of wheat rye barley oats and peas the hills where the
Why has your queen Juno called me here to this grassy spot
To celebrate a marriage of true love and give a gift to the lovers
Tell me rainbow do you know if either Venus the goddess of love or her son Cupid is accompanying Queen Juno
Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year I swore Id never speak to them again
Dont be afraid of her company
I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos in a carriage pulled by doves
They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day
But their trick failed
Venus went home again and her little son broke all his arrows swearing hell never shoot them again but play with birds like other little boys
Great Queen Juno is coming
I know her by her walk
How is my generous sister
Come help me bless this couple so they will be prosperous and have many children
This is a majestic and harmonious vision
Are these spirits we see before us
Yes theyre spirits that Ive called out of their prisons to perform my whims
Let me live here forever
Such a wonderful fatherinlaw and wife make this place a paradise
Now be quiet
Juno and Ceres are whispering about something serious
Theres something else to be done
Be silent or else my magic spell will be broken
Come sweet nymphs and help us celebrate the wedding of two true lovers
Dont be late
Now you tanned fieldworkers who are so tired of Augusts labors get out of the dirt and come rejoice with us here
Put your straw hats on have some fun and dance with these young nymphs
The moment they planned to act is almost here
Ive never seen him like this
We are all made of dreams and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death
Sir Im upset
Please put up with my weakness
My old brain is troubled
Dont be disturbed by my illness
If you like you can rest a while in my room
Ill go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind
We hope you feel better and find some peace
Come ArielI summon you with a thought
Thank you Ariel
Come
I obey all your thoughts
What do you wish
Spirit we have to get ready to meet with Caliban
Yes my master
When I was putting on the Ceres show I thought of reminding you about Caliban but I was afraid of upsetting you
Tell me again where did you leave those lowlifes
I told you sir they were totally drunk so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces and beating the ground for touching their feetyet even when drunk they kept their plan firmly in mind
Then I beat my drum at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes looking around for the source of my music
I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins
In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room with the stinking water covering them up to their chins
Good job my little one
Stay invisible
Bring the fancy clothes out of my house to use as bait to catch these thieves
Im going Im going
Hes a devil a born devil who can never be trained
As his body grows uglier with age his mind rots away as well
Ill torment them all till they roar with pain
Here hang them on this clothesline
Please walk softly so not even a mole hears us approach
Were near his room now
Hey monster the spirit youve been talking about the one you call harmless has been playing tricks on us
Monster I smell like horse piss which is making my nose pretty upset
Mine tooAre you listening monster
If I decide to get angry at you just watch out Youd be done for then monster
My good lord I still need you to like me
Be patient because the prize Im leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now
So be quiet
Its as silent as a graveyard here
That upsets me much more than getting wet
And you called the fairy creature harmless monster
Please my king be quiet
Look here this is the entrance to his room
Be silent and go in
Do the deed that will make this island yours forever and will make me Caliban your worshipful footlicker
Give me your hand
Im starting to feel murderous urges
Leave it alone you fool
Its worthless
Oh monster we know secondhand clothes when we see them Take off that gown Trinculo
I swear that gowns for me
You can have it then your highness
To hell with this idiot
Why are you going crazy over these trashy clothes
Leave them alone and do the murder first
If he wakes up before we kill him hell never stop punishing us
Thank you kindly
Thank you for that joke
As king of this country I like to reward wit when I hear it
Heres another jacket to say thanks
Come here monster put some glue on your fingers and carry away the rest of these clothes for us
I wont have any of this
Monster use your fingers
Help us carry these clothes to where my barrel of wine is hidden or Ill kick you out of my kingdom
Go on take them
Take these too
Yes and these
Hey Mountain hey
Silver
There they go Silver
My memory is hazy more like a dream than a recollection
Didnt I use to have four or five women taking care of me
Indeed you did and more besides Miranda
But how is it possible that you still remember this through all the darkness of the past
If you remember your life before you came here you may also remember how you got here
No that I dont remember
Twelve years ago Miranda twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan a powerful prince
Arent you my father
Your mother was extremely virtuous and she said you were my daughter
And your father was Duke of Milan and you were his heir a princess
Good lord
What evil things were done to us that we were driven here
Or was it a blessing that we came here
Both both my girl
We were pushed out of power by evil deeds as you call them
Fury FuryGet over there Tyrant there
Listen listen
Ariel go order my goblin servants to make these fellows bones ache give them muscle cramps all over and give them more bruises than leopards have spots
Listen theyre howling
Hunt them down
Now all my enemies are at my mercy
Soon all my work will be done and youll be free
Just obey me a little bit longer
My plans are almost at their climax
My spells are working well my spirits are obeying me and everything is right on schedule
What time is it
Its after six oclock my lord when you said our work would be finished
Thats what I said when I first conjured the tempest
Tell me spirit hows the king and his entourage
All cooped up together just as you ordered all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather
They cant move till you release them
The king his brother and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind and the rest are grieving over them sad and astonished
Good old lord Gonzalo as you call him is saddest of all with tears running down his beard
Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now youd feel sorry for them
Do you think so spirit
Id feel sorry for them if I were human
I will too
Its better to act virtuously rather than vengefully
Go release them Ariel
Ill break my spells and bring them back to their senses and theyll feel like themselves again
Ill go get them sir  
With his own lightning bolts Ive shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars Ive opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them letting them out with my powerful magic
But I surrender all this magic now when Ive summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell as Im doing now Ill break my staff and bury it far underground and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank
Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds which are now useless seething inside your skullsAll of you stand there in my spell
Why thats my dainty Ariel singing now
Ill miss you Ariel but youll be freeYes you will yesGo to the kings ship in your invisible state
This place is full of trouble torments and amazements
There must be a strange explanation for thisif its true
I surrender your dukedom and beg you to forgive me all my crimes
But how is it possible that Prosperos alive and well and living on this island  
I wont bet on whether or not any of this is real
Welcome my friends
Its the devil speaking through him
You suffered a loss like mine
Yes just as great and just as recent
And I have much less to comfort me than you do since Ive lost my daughter
A daughter
Oh God I wish the two of them were alive and living in Naples as king and queen
Id give up my life and take my sons place in the mud on the ocean floor if I could see them alive in NaplesWhen did you lose your daughter
In this recent storm
These lords seem so astonished that theyve lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyesBut whatever the reason for your losing your senses you can know for sure that Im Prospero that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed and became the lord of it
No my dearest love I wouldnt cheat you for the whole world
If this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up then Ill lose my son twice
A wonderful miracle  
Receive all the blessings of a happy father
Get up and tell me how you came here
How amazing
How many wonderful creatures there are here
Mankind is so beautiful
Oh what a wonderful new world that has such people in it
Its new to you
No sir shes human
But by the grace of God shes mine
I chose her for my wife when I thought I had no father to ask advice of
Shes the daughter of this famous Duke of Milan I heard so much about but never saw before
Hes given me a second life and marrying her makes him a second father to me
And Im her father as well
But oh how odd it is to have to ask for my childs forgiveness
Stop right there sir
Lets not get gloomy in our reminiscing since theres no reason for sadness anymore
Oh it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this things that I cant remember
But please tell me more
My brother your uncle Antoniojust listen to this I still cant believe a brother could be so disloyal
My brother whomaside from youI loved more than anyone else in the world I trusted to run my state which at that time was the strongest in the land and Prospero the number one duke famous for my dignity and my education
Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic grammar geometry and astronomy I let my control of the government slide a bit being too wrapped up in my occult books
Your disloyal uncleare you paying attention
Im hanging on every word
Oh yes I am father
Dear gods bless this couple since youre the ones who have shown us the path that led us here
Amen to that Gonzalo
Was the Duke of Milan kicked out of Milan so his children could become kings of Naples
Oh this is cause for an extraordinary joy that should be engraved in gold on pillars to last forever
On one and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis and Ferdinand her brother found a wife where he was shipwrecked Prospero found his dukedom on a poor island and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves
So be it
Amen
Oh look sir look sir
More of us are here
The best news of all is that weve located our king and our men
The next bit of good news is that our shipwhich we gave up for ruined only three hours agois as welloutfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail
These are unnatural events
In an instant we were separated from them as if in a dream and brought here in a daze    
This is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before and its not natural either
We need some oracle to tell us whats going on
Sir my king dont waste your time mulling over how strange this business is
How is my lord
If I can believe my eyes this is a fine sight to see
Oh Setebos these are handsome spirits
How wonderful my master is
Im afraid hell punish me
Ha ha
What are these things were looking at my lord Antonio
Can you buy them with money
Hell kill me with tortures
Isnt this Stephano my drunken butler
Hes definitely drunk now
Where did he get wine
And Trinculos drunk
How are you doing Stephano
Oh dont touch me
Im not Stephano Im a walking cramp
You wanted to be king of the island sir
I wouldve been a sore king then
Hes as ugly in his manners as he is in appearance I will indeed
And after this Ill be good and hope you forgive me
What an idiot I was to think this drunkard was a god and to worship such a stupid fool
Go away now
Or stole it rather
And in the morning Ill take you to your ship and well sail to Naples where I hope to see this loving couple married
Im dying to hear your life story which must be a strange tale
Now my spells are all broken And the only power I have is my own Which is very weak
Release me So I can return to my dukedom With your help
Just as youd like to have your sins forgiven Indulge me forgive me and set me free
Please listen to me carefully
As I neglected practical matters being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother
My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust wasmy trust which had no limit an infinite confidence
With his ambition growing like thisdo you hear what Im saying
Of course I hear it
My library was a large enough dukedom for me
Good heavens
Think about that and about what followed afterward
Then tell me if Antonio can be called a brother
It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother
The king of Naples my archenemy listens to my brothers request which was that the king in exchange for the respect and money paid to him would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead
How awful
I cant remember how I cried then but Ill cry all over again
This story breaks my heart
Just listen a little more and Ill bring you up to date about the present situation which is the whole reason Im telling you this story in the first place
Why didnt they just kill us that night
Good question my girl
My story does raise that question
The answer my dear is that they didnt dare because the people of Milan loved me too much
God what a burden on you I must have been
No my dear you were a little angel who kept me going
You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven while I cried salty tears into the salty sea and groaned at our situation
How did we manage to get ashore
With Gods help
We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples Gonzalo had given us out of the kindness of his heart
Knowing how much I loved my books he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom
I wish I could see that man someday
Now Ill stand up
May God thank you for it
But please fatherthe question is still nagging at mewhy did you conjure up this storm
You should know this much luck is on my side and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island
Now no more questions
Its a nice hazy feeling so give in to it
I know you have no choice
Come on servant come
Im ready now
Come here Ariel
Humble greetings great master
Worthy sir greetings
Spirit did you carry out the storm just as I ordered
Sometimes I appeared in many places at once
I flashed about faster than lightning
Good spirit
Boatswain
Im here sir
Hurry hurry
Come on men
Thats the way to do it
Wheres the Master
Make these men work
Please stay below deck sir
Wheres the Master Boatswain
Everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts
Everyone except the sailors dove into the sea leaving behind the ship that I had set on fire
The kings son Ferdinand with his hair standing straight upit looked like reeds not hairwas the first person to jump shouting Hell is empty and all the devils are here Good job
But was this near the shore
Very near my master
But are they all safe Ariel
Nobody was hurt in the slightest
Even their clothes are unstained and look fresher than before the storm
Ive separated them into groups around the island just as you ordered
I sent the kings son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island where hes sitting now sighing with his arms crossed like this
Tell me what you did with the kings ship the sailors and the other ships
The sailors are all below deck sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell I cast over them
As for the rest of the ships I scattered them and theyve gathered again in the Mediterranean sailing sadly home to Naples believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king
Ariel youve done your work exactly as I ordered
But theres more work to be done
What time is it
Past noon
At least two hours past
We cant waste time between now and six oclock
Is there more work to do
Since youre giving me new assignments let me remind you what you promised me but havent come through with yet
What
Youre in a bad mood
What could you possibly ask for
My freedom
Before your sentence has been completed
Dont say anything else
I beg you remember the good work Ive done for you and how Ive never lied to you never made mistakes and never grumbled in my work
You promised to take a full year off my sentence
Have you forgotten the torture I freed you from
No
You have forgotten and you think its a burden when I ask you to walk through the ocean or run on the north wind or do business for me underground when the earths frozen solid
No I dont sir
You lie you nasty ungrateful thing
Have you forgotten the horrid witch Sycorax stooped over with old age and ill will
Have you forgotten her
No sir
You have
Where was she born
Speak
Tell me
In Algiers sir
Oh was she now
Ill have to tell the story again every month since you seem to forget it
This damned witch Sycorax was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about
But for one reason they refused to execute her
Isnt that true
Yes sir
This sunkeneyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors
You my slave were her servant at the time as you admit yourself
In a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine tree with the help of her powerful assistants and left you there for twelve years
Thats right you stupid thing
Caliban who now serves me
It was my magic that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you making the pine tree open and let you out
Thank you master
If you complain any more Ill split an oak tree and lock you up in it till youve howled for twelve years
Please forgive me master
Ill be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining
Do that and Ill set you free in two days
Thats noble of you master
What shall I do for you
Just tell me
What shall I do
Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph
Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me
Take this garment put it on and then come back here
Hurry go
Shake off your sleepiness
Come on
Well go visit Caliban my slave who always talks to us so nastily  
But even so we cant do without him
He builds our fires gets our firewood and does all kinds of useful things for usHey
Caliban
Pile of dirt
Say something
Come out I order you
Theres other work for you to do
Come on you turtle
What a fine sight
My dear clever Ariel listen carefully
My lord Ill do it right away
I hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crows feather from the poison swamps
May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over
Ill give you cramps for saying thathorrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing
Ill send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you
Youll be pricked all over and itll sting like bees
I have to eat my dinner now
This island belongs to me because Sycorax my mother left it to me
I curse myself for doing that
You liar you respond better to the whip than to kindness
I took good care of youpiece of filth that you areand let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter
Oh ho oh ho
I wish I had
You stopped me
You horrid slave you cant be trained to be good and youre capable of anything evil
I pitied you worked hard to teach you to speak and taught you some new thing practically every hour
But you had bad blood in you no matter how much you learned and good people couldnt stand to be near you
So you got what you deserved and were locked up in this cave which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be
You taught me language and all I can do with it is curse
Damn you for teaching me your language
No please
Go then slave
The watchdogs bark
Listen listen
Wheres that music coming from
From the earth or the air
Its stopped nowit must be played for some local god of the island
As I sat on the shore crying over my fathers shipwreck I heard the music creep over the wild waves calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies
I followed it here or I should say it dragged me here
But now its stopped
No there it is again
Listen I hear them
This songs about my dead father
I hear it now overhead
What is it
A spirit
Lord its glancing every which way
How handsome it is
It must be a spirit
No girl
It eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do
Hes lost his comrades and is wandering around looking for them
Hes busy cant you hear him giving orders
Youre getting in the way of our work
Stay in your cabins
Youre helping the storm not us
Dont get wound up my good man
Now get out of here
Go to your cabins and be quiet
Dont bother us up here
Just remember who youve got on board with you good man
Nobody I care about more than myself
Youre a kings advisor
Go ahead use your authority
If you cant do it be grateful youve lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin if it comes to thatHarder menNow get out of our way Im telling you
I feel a lot better after talking to this guy
I could imagine hes divine since I never saw anything so noblelooking on earth before
Im not marvelous sir but Im certainly a maiden
She speaks my language
My God Im the highestranking person who speaks this languageif only we were back where its spoken
Whats that
The highestranking
What would the King of Naples do if he heard you say that
He would just see me for what I am a person amazed to hear you talking about Naples
He does hear me and that makes me cry
I myself am the King of Naples since I saw with my own eyesthese eyes that havent been dry sincemy father killed in a shipwreck
Ah how pitiful
Yes indeed and all the Kings men the Duke of Milan and his fine son too
Hang on sir
Just a moment
If the devil had such a beautiful house as his body then good things would fight to live in it
Whats that
Get out of that position because I can disarm you with my magic wand and make your sword drop
Please father I beg you
Let go of me
Dont tug on my clothes
Father take pity on him
Quiet
If you say one more word Ill punish you maybe even hate you
Youre defending an impostor
You think hes special since youve only ever seen him and Caliban
Foolish girl in the eyes of most people this mans a Caliban and compared to him theyre angels
Then my love is humble
I dont feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one
Thats true they are
My strength is all gone as if in a dream
The death of my father my physical weakness the loss of all my friends the threats of this man whos taken me prisonerall that would be easy for me to take if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl
A prison like that would give me enough liberty  
Please say no more
What a pain
Pain yes indeed
You thought you were being funny but you said the truth
Youre taking it more seriously than I meant it
Well Im nearly finished
Which one will start yammering first Gonzalo or Adrian
The old guy
I pick the younger one
Youre on
Whats the prize
A good laugh
Its a deal
Though this island may appear desolate  
The island must be mild and have a temperate climate
I knew Temperanceshe was a fine girl
Yes and she was mild too
Theres always a breath of fresh air here
Stinking like a swamp
This island contains everything beneficial to life
True
Everything except something to live on
Theres little or nothing of that
Look how lush and healthy the grass is
How green
The ground is brown
With a touch of green in it
He doesnt miss a thing
No he just gets reality completely wrong
But the really unbelievable thing isand this is incredible As most unbelievable things are
That our clothes were drenched with sea water but they came out looking brandnew
Or stuff what he says into their pockets
Seriously I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in Africa when we attended the marriage of the kings daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis
It was a lovely wedding and were doing really well on our trip home
Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen
Next thing you know hell be saying widower Aeneas Widow Dido did you say
Im not sure about that
Dido was from Carthage not Tunis
Carthage
Im telling you it was Carthage
Gonzalo is a miracleworker
What miracle will he work next
I think hell carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple
And then throw the seeds in the sea to make more islands grow
Yes indeed
Absolutely yes indeed  
Bring down that top sail
Fast
Let the ship sail close to the wind
Damn those men shouting down there
Theyre louder than the storm or us sailors
Oh not you again
What do you want
Should we all give up and drown
Do you want to sink
Yes I guarantee he wont drowneven if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman
Turn the ship to the wind
Its no use
Were done for
The most beautiful queen they ever had
I beg your pardon except for the widow Dido
Oh except for the widow Dido
Thats right except for the widow Dido
Isnt my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put it on
In a way I mean
In a way is the right way to go
I mean when I wore it at your daughters wedding
You keep cramming words into my ears that I dont want to hear
Sir he may still be alive
I have no doubt he got ashore alive
No no hes dead
Please be quiet
We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an African and the desire to obey you
Now Im afraid weve lost your son forever
Our shipwreck has made more women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort them
And its all your fault
And the greatest sorrow is mine too
My lord Sebastian even though what you say is true your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time
Youre rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages
All right Ill stop
Like a good doctor  
Bad times
Yes very bad
If I could colonize this island my lord Hed cultivate weeds on it
Or thornbushes
And if I were king of it you know what Id do
He wouldnt get drunk much since theres no wine here
I wouldnt allow any commerce
Thered be no work
Thered be no kingship He wants to be king in a place with no kingship
Everything would be produced without labor and would be shared by all
Nature would produce its harvests in abundance to feed my innocent people
Thered be no marriage
No
Oh please be quiet
Youre absolutely right your highness
Its you we were laughing at
Ouch what a comeback
Too bad it fell flat
Youre brave gentlemen
Youd give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit
Thats right and then after we fixed the moon wed go birdhunting
Im not
Go to sleep and listen to us laughing
What everybody falls asleep so fast
I wish I could sleep tooit would stop me from thinking
Come to think of it I am feeling sleepy
In that case you should sleep
The two of us will guard you while you sleep my lord and keep you safe
Thank you
Im terribly sleepy
How strange that they all got so sleepy
There must be something in the air here
So why arent our eyelids heavy
Im not sleepy at all
Me neither
Im wide awake
They all fell asleep together as if theyd planned it
Opportunitys knocking for you and in my imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head
Are you dreaming or awake
Dont you hear me speaking
I do and it sounds like youre talking in your sleep
What did you say
Youre snoring but it sounds like youre talking
Theres meaning in your snoring
Ill show you how
You need to
Oh if you only knew how close to success you are even while you make fun of what Im telling you
The more you joke about it the more clearly I feel how serious it is
Lazy people end up at the bottom and you deserve to be at the top
Please tell me more
Yes Im sure hes dead
Ive got no hope that he survived
But in that no hope there are great hopes for you
Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned
Hes dead
So in that case tell me whos next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples
Claribel his daughter
Its true that my brothers daughter is Queen of Tunis and heir of Naples
I could do it myself
Do you even get what Im saying
I think I do
And does this prospect of good fortune make you happy
I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero
My brothers servants used to be my equals
Now they work for me
But what about your guilty conscience
Yes
I dont feel anything
As
for the other men we can make them believe anything we choose
Theyll set their watches to whatever time we say
Youll be my role model
Just as you got Milan Ill get Naples
Take out your sword
With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples
And as king Ill love you forever
You take out your sword too
When I raise my hand you do the same and bring it down on Gonzalos head
Oh but theres one more thing to tell you
What were going to die
The king and the prince are praying
Im out of patience
This bigmouth jerk here Hell still die by hanging not drowning even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him
Lets all sink with the king
Lets say goodbye to him
Lets act quickly
Why are your swords out
Why do you look like that
Whats this all about
While we were here guarding you as you slept we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls or lions
Didnt you hear it
We heard it very clearly
I didnt hear anything
Oh it was a monstrous roar to make the earth tremble
Im sure there was a herd of lions nearby
Did you hear this Gonzalo
Its true I heard a humming sound a strange one which woke me up
I shook you and shouted at you sir
When I opened my eyes I saw their swords out
There was a noise thats certainly true
Lets draw our own swords too
I hope those lions stay far away from him
Im sure hes somewhere on the island
Get us out of here  
His spirits are listening to me but I cant help cursing him anyway
They wont pinch me frighten me push me in the mud or mislead me unless he tells them to
Sometimes snakes wrap around me hissing at me with their forked tongues till I go crazy
Hey look over there
Maybe he wont see me
There are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here
And theres another storm brewingI can hear it in the way the wind whistles
That huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug thats about to pour out its contents
A strange fish
If I were in England now like I was once and I had even a painted picture of this fish every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it
In England this strange monster would be just like a man
Any strange beast there can be considered a man
The men there wont give a penny to a lame beggar but theyll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit
This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms
And hes still warm by God
I guess this is not a fish but a native who got struck by lightning just now
Oh here comes the storm again
The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak
Theres no other shelter around here
In emergencies you meet the strangest folks
Ill just stay here till the storm passes
This is a rotten song to sing at a mans funeral
At least Ive got some booze to comfort me
Dont hurt me
Oh
Whats going on
Do we have devils on the island
Are you playing tricks on me by showing me savages and uncivilized men from the Indies ha
I didnt survive a shipwreck so I could be scared of your four legs now
The spirit is torturing me
Oh
This is some monster of the island with four legs who seems to me to have some kind of ache
How the hell does he know our language
Ill help out if only because he speaks the same language as me
If I can cure him from his fever and tame him and get him back to Naples hed make a great present for any emperor
Dont hurt me please
I promise Ill carry the wood faster
Hes having a fit and talking nonsense
Ill give him some liquor
If hes never drunk it before itll help soothe his fever
If I can tame him Ill charge as much as I can get for him
Hell bring a lot of money to the person who owns him thats for sure
Now you lie there on the path
She said if she were interested in someone it would be someone who looked like me
Besides she treats me more respectfully than the other servants
Whats the obvious conclusion from that
Just think I could be Count Malvolio      
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager
Id send seven of my servants to go get him
While I waited Id frown impatiently and perhaps wind my watch or play with mywith some expensive piece of jewelry I happen to be wearing
I cant let my lips say his name No man must know
No man must know What comes after that
No man must know What if this someone were you Malvolio
But silence like a knife cuts open my heart With strokes that draw no blood
rules my life Hmm let me see let me see let me see
I may command the one I love Well she commands me
Why anyone can see what this means
Theres no ambiguity here
If only I could somehow relate them to me
You seem to be a good person captain and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners
Pleaseand Ill pay you plenty for thishelp me conceal my identity and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want
I want to be this Dukes servant
Youll introduce me to him as a eunuch
You wont be wasting your time because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music so hell be happy to have me in his service
You can be a eunuch but Ill be mute
I swear on my life I wont tell your secret
Thank you
Show me the way
MMalvolio
Mwhy thats the first letter in my name
But if I shake it up a little itll work because every one of those letters is in my name
But wait theres some prose after her poem
If this letter falls into your hands think carefully about what it says
By my birth I rank above you but dont be afraid of my greatness
Some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them
Your fate awaits you
Accept it in body and spirit
To get used to the life youll most likely be leading soon get rid of your lowclass trappings
Go ahead
Goodbye
Signed she who would be your servant     The Fortunate Unhappy This is as clear as sunlight in an open field
Ill do it
Ill be vain and proud Ill read up on politics Ill insult Sir Toby Ill get rid of my lowerclass friends and Ill be the perfect man for her
I know Im not fooling myself or letting myself get carried away by my imagination because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs
Oh I thank my lucky stars Im so happy
For her Ill be strange and condescending and Ill put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away
Thank God and my horoscope
Heres a postscript
You must have figured out who I am
If you love me let me know by smiling at me
Youre so attractive when you smile
Please smile whenever youre near me my dearest darling
Dear God thank you
Ill do everything she wants me to do
I wouldnt have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds to be paid by the shah of Persia
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up
So could I
And I wouldnt ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one
Neither would I
Here she comes the brilliant foolcatcher
May I kiss your feet
And I too
Shall I be your slave
Me too
Youve made him so delusional hell go crazy when he learns the truth
Did it really work
Like medicine for a sick man
If you want to watch follow me
Id follow you to the gates of Hell you sneaky little devil
Ill come too
God bless you my friend and your music too
Do you make your living by playing that drum
No sir I live by the church
Oh youre a clergyman
You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him or that the church is supported by your drum because it stands by your drum
Youre right sir
What a wonderful time to be alive
Thats true
Thats why I wish my sister didnt have a name sir
Why man
Well her names a word and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore
Why do you say that
Honestly sir Id need to use words to explain why and since words are so unreliable and false Id rather avoid using them in a serious discussion
I bet youre a happy fellow who doesnt care about anything
Youre wrong sir I do care about something
But Ill admit I dont care for you
If that means I dont care about anything you should disappear right now since youre nothing
Arent you Lady Olivias fool
No sir
I saw you at Count Orsinos recently
Im everywhere
I think I saw you there you wise man
Wait heres a coin for you
Next time God sends out a shipment of hair I hope he gives you a beard
Oh I know
Yes if you kept them together and invested them
My lady Olivias inside sir
Ill tell them where you come from though I dont know who you are or what you want
Id say I was out of my element but that phrase is overused so Ill say Im out of my air
This guys wise enough to play the fool and only clever people can do that
And he doesnt let go of his target when a distraction appears
Hello sir
Hello to you too sir
Im headed for your niece sir
Shes the reason Im here
Taste your legs sir
Please go inside
I mean please go into the house sir
I will
But now we dont have to
Oh beautiful and accomplished lady may the heavens rain odors upon you
My message is not for anyone else to hear my lady
Its only for your willing and receptive ear
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message
Give me your hand sir
I give you my obedience and my humble service madam
Whats your name
Cesario is my nameyour servants namefair princess
My servant
The worlds gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments
As for him I never think about him
As for his thoughts I wish hed think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time
Madam Ive come here to try to make you like him
Oh please Im begging you dont mention him again
My dear lady Please let me say something Im begging you
After you cast your magic spell on me last time I sent you a ring
What else could you possibly think of me
Whats wrong with my niece
For Gods sake Sir Toby youve got to come home earlier at night
My lady Olivia your niece disapproves of your latenight partying
Well she can get used to it
Keep myself
Theyre good enough to drink in and so are these boots
If they arent they can go hang themselves by their own laces
Who Sir Andrew Aguecheek
Yes thats the one
Hes as 
Havent you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough
So let me hear what you have to say
I feel sorry for you
Thats a step in the direction of love
No not at all
Its much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one
I wish you all the best
You do Stay Please tell me what you think of me
I think youre denying what you really are
If thats true I think the same thing about you
I wish you were what I wanted you to be
Would it be better if I were that instead of what I am
I wish I were something better because right now Im a big fool
So goodbye my lady
No I wont stay a second longer
Why are you leaving my angry friend
Yes you have to tell us why Sir Andrew
Well because I saw your niece Olivia treat the counts messenger better than shes ever treated me
I saw it in the orchard
Did she see you there the whole time old boy
Tell me that
Yes she saw me quite clearly
Well that proves shes in love with you
Are you trying to make fun of me
No Ill prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument
And you cant deny evidence and argumentTheyve been around since Noahs ark
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you fire up your passions and make you angry and jealous
You should have run up to her unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot and rendered the young man speechless
Thats what she was expecting and you let her down
Ill have to do something courageous then because I hate intrigue
Id rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots
Well then improve your situation with a show of courage
Challenge the counts young servant to a fight
Hurt him in eleven different places
My niece Olivia will notice and let me tell you no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage
Its really the only way Sir Andrew
Will either of you give him the message that Im challenging him to a duel
Go ahead and write it down
Be pointed and brief
It doesnt need to be witty as long as its eloquent and imaginative
Go on
This precious little guy is putty in your hands Sir Toby
His letters going to be hilarious
But youre not going to deliver it are you
Never trust me again if I dont
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it
I dont think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight
Here comes my little bird
Listen if you want a good laughand I mean a sidesplitting onethen follow me
Hes wearing yellow stockings
With crisscrossed laces
Oh he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher
He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies
Youve never seen anything like it
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him
I know that my ladys going to end up hitting him
And when she does hell imagine shes flirting with him
Come on take us to him
I couldnt stay behind after you left
My friend Antonio all I can say is thank you
Anyway what should we do
Should we go see the sights in the town
You probably killed a lot of his men
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from themwhich most of our city did for the sake of friendly trade relations
I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole
Then dont make yourself too conspicuous
Youre right
Hang on a minute heres some money for you
Maybe youll see some little trinket you want to buy
Ill hold on to your money and leave you for an hour
Well meet at the Elephant
I remember
Ive sent for him
He says hell come
Its easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them
Oh Im talking too loudWheres Malvolio
Hes very serious which is right for someone in mourning like me
Where is Malvolio
Hes coming madam but hes acting very strangely
He must be possessed by the devil
Why whats the matter with him
Is he talking nonsense
No he just smiles
You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here because hes clearly disturbed
Ask him in here
Im as crazy as he is if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent
Whats going on Malvolio
Hello sweet lady
Why he has an income of three thousand ducats a year
Hes a fool and a spendthrift
You shouldnt talk about him like that
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage
Who said that
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night
We only drink toasts to my niece
Ill drink to her as long as theres a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merrygoround is scum
Sir Toby Belch
How are you Sir Toby Belch
Sweet Sir Andrew
Youre smiling
I sent for you about a sad occasion
Sad my lady
I could be sad if I wanted to be
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit but who cares
As the sonnet says If you please one special person you please everyone who matters Why whats going on
Whats the matter with you
My legs may be yellow but I dont feel blue
It was addressed to him and orders must be obeyed
I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was
Dont you think you should go to bed Malvolio
To bed
How are you feeling Malvolio
Youre asking me
Noble people dont answer to peasants
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady
Dont be afraid of greatness That was well written
What do you mean by that Malvolio
Some are born great
What
Some achieve greatness What are you saying
And some have greatness thrust upon them Heaven help you
Remember who liked your yellow stockings Your yellow stockings
And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs Crisscrossed
Go ahead
Madam Count Orsinos young messenger has returned
Ill go to him
Maria take care of this poor fellow here
Wheres my cousin Toby
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio
Id give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him
Oh ho
Look at me now
This is just what the letter said
Get rid of your lowclass trapping she said
Ive got her now but Ive got God to thank for it
And when she left just now she said Take care of this poor fellow here Fellow Not Malvolio not anything referring to my low station in life but fellow Everythings going perfectly
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes
Well God is responsible for that not me and he deserves thanks
I dont care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him I still want to speak to him
Here he is here he is
How are you sir
Go away
Let me enjoy my privacy
Go away
Ahha
Does she
Do you even know what youre talking about
Sure thing well do it tomorrow morning
My lady would never want to lose him
What are you saying mistress
Oh Lord
Gentleness is the only way to gogently gently
The devil inside him is rough but we cant treat it roughly
Sir
Yes dear little chick come along with meShut up man
Youre serious enough to know not to play games with Satan
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil
Get him to say his prayers Sir Toby get him to pray
My prayers you hussy
Go hang yourselves all of you
Youre all lazy and shallow
Im not like you
Youll know more about it later
Is it possible
If this were a play Id complain it was unrealistic
Hes really taken this prank to heart
No follow him now before he divulges the prank and ruins everything
Wow were really going to drive him crazy
The house will be so much quieter
Come on lets put him in a dark room and tie him up
My niece already thinks hes insane
Heres more insanity for us
Is it that aggressive
Yes it is I think
Just read it
Give it to me
Thats a good thing to put init keeps you from getting in trouble with the law
Nice and short and full of good senseor should I say nonsense
Good
You still havent said anything incriminating
Good
Andrew Aguecheek
If this letter doesnt make him fight I dont know what will
Ill give it to him
You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now
Hes conducting some business with my lady and sooner or later hell leave
Go Sir Andrew
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriffs deputy
Now go
Dont worry about me not swearing enough
The fact that he serves as a gobetween for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this
So this letter which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant isnt going to scare him at all
Hell just think an idiot wrote it
But Ill deliver Sir Andrews challenge by word of mouth describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious impetuous and a skilled fighter hell believe me because hes young
This will make them both so afraid that theyll kill each other just by looking at each other
Here comes the messenger with your niece
Leave them alone until he sets off home and then follow him
Meanwhile Ill think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge
My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do
Here take this piece of jewelry
Theres a picture of me inside
Dont refuse it
It wont annoy you like me because it doesnt have a voice
And I beg you please come here again tomorrow
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldnt give you as long as it didnt damage my honor and selfrespect
Nothing except your true love for my lord
How could I honorably give him what Ive already given you
Ill give it back to you
Just come again tomorrow
Goodbye
A devil like you could lead me to hell
Hello sir
Hello to you
Youd better think up a way to defend yourself
I dont know what youve done to upset him but someone has challenged you to a duel
Draw your sword and get on your toes because your assailant is quick skillful and deadly
There must be some mistake sir
Im sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me
I cant remember anything Ive ever done to offend anyone
Youre wrong about that I assure you
But who is this person sir
Hes a knight
Hes killed three people and hes so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die
Fight to the death is his motto
Hello sir
Chat her up Sir Andrew
What
My dear Miss Chatherup I look forward to getting to know you better
My name is Mary sir
I was telling you to go after her woo her confront her
Is that really what you meant
If you let her go this easily Sir Andrew you dont deserve to ever use your sword again
If you leave like this my dear I wont ever use my sword again
Do you think youve got a couple of fools on your hands here
Im not holding your hand sir
Ill go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort
Im not a fighter
Ive heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose just to see how brave they are
This man is probably like that
No sir
Hes furious because you insulted him and he has a right to satisfaction
So go out there and give him what he wants
You cant go back into the house unless you want to fight with meand if youre willing to do that you might as well just go and fight with him
This is as rude as it is strange
Please do me this one favor find out what Ive done to offend this knight
It must be something I did accidentally
I will do so
Mr Fabian stay with this gentleman until I come back
Excuse me sir do you know anything about this
What kind of man is he
He really is the most skillful bloodthirsty and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria
Do you want to go see him
Ill try to calm him down for you if I can
Id be very grateful to you if you did
Wow hes a real devil
Ive never seen such a monster
I had a round with him and his sword thrust is so deadly that you cant even duck out of the way
And when he strikes back at you hell hit you as sure as youre standing there
They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia
Thats it
I wont mess with him
Yes but now theres no way to calm him down
Fabian can hardly control him over there
Darn it if Id guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman I never would have challenged him
Ill give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing
Ill give it a try
Stay right here and try to look good
This may end without anyone getting killed 
Hes just as terrified of Sir Andrew
Hes pale and hyperventilating as if a bear were chasing him
Come on Sir Andrew theres nothing you can do about it
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you for the sake of his honor
The rules of dueling say he has to
But as a gentleman and a soldier hes promised me he wont hurt you
Come on get ready
I hope to God he keeps his promise
I swear to you I dont want to be doing this
Put your sword away
If this young gentleman has offended you Ill take the blame for it
If youve offended him Ill fight you
You sir
Who are you
In fact Id do even more to him than what youve heard him promise to do
If youre someone who gets into fights Ill fight with you
Oh Sir Toby stop
The police are here
I certainly will sir
And as for what I promised to you Im as good as my word
You can ride him easily and he responds well when you pull the reins
This is the man
Do your job
Antonio youre under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino
You must be mistaking me for someone else sir
No sir not at all
I recognize your face perfectly even without a sailors cap on your headTake him away
He knows I recognize him
I have to obey 
Dont worry about me
Come on sir lets go
What money sir
Take this
Its half of all my money
Are you really going to pretend you dont know me now
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying vanity babbling drunkenness or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to Oh my God
Come on sir please
Lets go
Lets go
But oh what a deceiver he turned out to be
Only really cruel people can be called deformed
Virtue is beauty but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil
The mans going crazy
Take him away
Take me
I dont believe it
Yet I wish I could
Oh please be true please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you my dear brother
Come here Sir Andrew
You too Fabian
Weve got some words of wisdom to mull over
He called me Sebastian
with the same accessories
Oh if it turns out to be true that he survived then that storm was kind and the ocean was full of love
Hes a very dishonest puny boy and more cowardly than a rabbit
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency and even pretended he didnt know him
As for his cowardliness ask Fabian
Hes a coward a total coward
By God Ill go after him again and beat him up
I swear I will Come on lets go see what happens
Ill bet anything you like that nothing will happen once again
Leave me alone
Good for you holding out on me like this
No I dont know you and my lady didnt send me to get you and Im not supposed to tell you to come speak with her and your name is not Master Cesario and this is not my nose either
Nothing is what it is
Oh please go somewhere else to blab your nonsense
You dont know me
Blab my nonsense
He mustve heard that phrase describing some great man and now hes using it on a jester
Blab my nonsense
What an idiotic place this world is
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady
Should I blab to her that youre coming
Please fool go away
Heres money for you
Well well
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputationif they keep up regular payments for fourteen years
Stop right now or Ill throw your dagger over the roof
No leave him alone
Ill get back at him another way
Ill sue him for assault and battery if theres any justice in Illyria
It doesnt matter that I hit him first
No sir I wont let you go
Come on put your sword away my little soldier
Youre awfully eager to fight
Come on
Ill get free of you
What are you going to do now
If you insist on trying my patience any further then take out your sword right now
What
Because then Id have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood
Stop Sir Toby
I order you to stop
Madam
Are you always going to be like this
Get out of my sightDear Cesario please dont be offendedGet out of here you barbarian
You have to come with me
Please dont say no
Damn that Toby
He made my heart leap for you  
Why sweetheart
Your hand is  Well I hope so
Im not such an idiot that I cant keep my hands dry
But I dont get itwhats the joke
Just a bit of my dry humor sir
Are you always so funny
But oops when I let go of your hand I let go of the biggest joke of all
Sir you need a drink
When has anyone ever put you down like that
Never
Sometimes I think Im no smarter than average
If this is a dream let me keep on sleeping
Come with me please
I wish youd do what I ask
Madam I will
Oh say it and mean it
No Im telling you put on this robe and beard
Make him think youre Sir Topas the priest
Be quick
Meanwhile Ill get Sir Toby
Here come the conspirators
God bless you Mr
Priest
Go to him Sir Topas
The fools a good actor
A good fool
Sir Topas Sir Topas good Sir Topas please go find my lady Olivia Get out demon
Why are you bothering this poor man
Cant you talk about anything besides ladies
You should be ashamed of yourself Satan you liar
Im being gentle with you because Im one of those goodhearted people who are polite to the devil himself
You call this house dark
Dark as hell Sir Topas
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls and the upper windows facing southnorth are as clear as coal
But youre still complaining of darkness and a bad view
Im not insane Sir Topas
Im telling you this house is dark
Youre wrong you madman
Theres no darkness except ignorance and youre more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog
I tell you this house is as dark as ignorance
Im no more insane than you are and Ill prove it
Ask me any commonsense question
What was the philosopher Pythagorass belief about wild birds
That our grandmothers soul could end up inhabiting a bird
What do you think of his belief
I respect the soul very much so I disagree with his belief
Well then goodbye
Stay in the dark
Ill only admit that youre sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmothers soul
Goodbye
Sir Topas Sir Topas
The brilliant Sir Topas
I can do anything
You couldve done this without your beard and gown
He couldnt see you
Now talk to him in your own voice and tell me how he is
I wish this trick would be over
Im in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldnt be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion
Come to my room later on
Fool
Fool
Fool I say
Good fool good jester Ill make it worth your while if you get me a candle and a pen ink and paper
You have my word as a gentleman that Ill always be grateful to you
Master Malvolio
Yes good fool
As sane as me
Then you really are insane if youre no saner than a fool
Sir Topas
Fool fool hey fool
Please sir be quiet
What do you want to say sir
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper
I tell you Im as sane as any man in Illyria
If only you were sir
I swear I am
Get me some ink paper and a candle
Youll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before
Ill help you
But tell me honestly are you sure youre not insane
Or are you just pretending
Believe me Im not
Im telling the truth
Ill never believe a madman until I can see his brains
But Ill get you a candle and paper and ink
Fool Ill repay you for this favor
Please hurry                    
This is the air thats the glorious sun
Wheres Antonio then
I didnt find him at the Elephant
But hed been there before me and they told me hed gone out looking for me
I could really use his advice right now
Theres something going on thats not what it seems
But here she comes
Ill follow the priest and go with you and after Ive sworn to be faithful Ill be faithful forever
Then lead the way father
If youre my friend youll let me see his letter
Dear Mr Fabian do me another favor first
Anything
Dont ask to see this letter
My friends are you all Lady Olivias servants
Yes sir were part of her entourage
I know you
How are you my friend
Im better off because of my enemies and worse off because of my friends
Youre better off because of your friends
No sir worse off
How can that be
By the way Im going home tomorrow Sir Toby
What does  Youd have a great hairstyle if you had
Why would that have fixed my hair
Oh no questionit wont style itself
But my hair looks good anyway doesnt it
It looks great
It hangs like an old wornout mop
Listen Im going home tomorrow Sir Toby
That duke who lives nearby is courting her
Ive heard her say that
So cheer up theres still hope for you man
Well my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot
My enemies help me understand myself better which is an advantage and my friends help me lie about myself which is a disadvantage
So if four negatives make two affirmatives Im worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes
Thats excellent
Dont say thatunless you want to be one of my friends
Thats a nice hand you dealt me
But if its not doubledealing sir I wish youd deal me another
Oh youre a naughty one encouraging doubledealing
Well Ill commit the sin of doubledealing and deal you a second coin
Here it is
And maybe a third
The threebeat rhythm is a good for dancing and the church bells chimeone two three
You cant get any more money out of me right now
If you tell your lady Im here to speak with her and bring her out with you when you come back you might make me more generous
Well then sing a lullaby to your generosity itll nap until I come back
But dont think Im doing this because Im greedy
Ill be back soon to wake up your generosity
Here comes the man who rescued me sir
I remember his face well
Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war
He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small
Orsino this is the same Antonio who took the 
But then he said strange things to me
I dont know what else it could be
But youre a famous pirate
Orsino sir please dont call me those names
I was never a thief or a pirate though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning
He was a wreck almost past hope
I saved his life and gave him my love without reservation
How is that possible  
Ah the countess is coming
An angel is walking on earth
What can I give you that you want my lord except the one thing you cant have
Cesario you missed your appointment with me
Madam
Dearest Olivia What do you have to say for yourself CesarioMy lord please My lord wants to speak
Its my duty to be quiet
Are you still so cruel
I am still so faithful my lord
What faithful to being mean and nasty
I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offeredwhat more am I supposed to do
You can do whatever you want as long as its socially appropriate
Come with me boy
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully if it made your life easier
Wheres Cesario going
Thats the truth
Who tricked you
Who treated you badly
Have you completely forgotten
Has it been so long
Call the priest
Go where my lordCesario my husband stay here
Husband
Yes husband
Can he deny it
Are you her husband boy
No my lord not me
But dont be afraid Cesario
Be the person you know you are and youll be as powerful as this person you fear
Oh hello father
Father could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man
My lord I swear to you Oh dont swear
Keep a little bit of honesty even if youre afraid
For the love of God call a doctor
Sir Toby needs help right away
Whats the matter
He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head too
For the love of God help us
Id give forty pounds to be safe at home right now
Who did this Sir Andrew
The counts messenger Cesario
We thought he was a coward but he fights like a devil
My Cesario
Anything I did to you I did it because Sir Toby made me
Why are you talking like this
I never hurt you
If a bloody head counts as a hurt then you hurt me
Apparently you think theres nothing unusual about a bloody head
Here comes Sir Toby limping
Hell tell you more of the story
If he hadnt been drunk he wouldve really roughed you up
Hello sir
How are you
It doesnt matter how I am he hurt me and thats that
Oh hes drunk Sir Toby for a whole hour now
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning
Then hes no good
I hate nogood drunks
Take him away
Who did this to him
Ill help you Sir Toby
Will you help meWhat an ass and a fool a gullible nogood idiot
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated
But please forgive me darling for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently
One face one voice one way of dressing but two people
Antonio oh my dear Antonio
Ive been so tortured since I lost track of you
Are you Sebastian
Do you have any doubts Antonio
How did you divide yourself in two
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple
Which one is Sebastian
How unbelievable
Sebastian was my fathers name and my brother was named Sebastian too
I am a spirit yes since I have a soul
If you were a woman Id hug you now and cry and say Welcome back drowned Viola My father had a mole on his forehead
Mine did too
He died on Violas thirteenth birthday
All right Ill stay another month
Ah Im an odd kind of guy
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing
Are you good at those kinds of things
Why do you hide these things
Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain
Are they likely to get dusty
Why dont you go off to church dancing one way and come home dancing another way
I wouldnt even pee without dancing a waltz
What are you thinking
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments
Look how shapely your legs are
Thats true
Why not
Werent we both born under Taurus
Oh I remember that very clearly
Its true he died on the day my sister turned thirteen
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in womans clothing
The captain who brought me to shore has my womens clothes
For some reason hes in prison now on some legal technicality on Malvolios orders
Hell release him
I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him
Well he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation
Hes written you a letter
I wouldve given it to you this morning but a madmans letters arent Gospel so it doesnt matter much if Im a bit late
Open it and read it
Theres a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman
Why are you talking like that
Are you insane
No madam Im just reading an insane letter
If you want things done in the right way youll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice
No please read it like a sane person
I will my lady but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy
So listen up princess
I swear to God madam youve wronged me and Ill tell the whole world
Youve shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me but Im as sane as you are
I dont care what you think of me
Im going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries youve caused me
Signed    The poorly treated Malvolio Did he write this
Yes madam
Set him free
Fabian bring him here
I accept that offer happily madam
Is this the madman
Yes my lord
How are you Malvolio
Madam youve treated me badly very badly
I did Malvolio
No  
Tell me why you did it
Im sorry Malvolio but this isnt my writing though I admit it looks like mine
Its definitely Marias handwriting
Now that I think about it Maria was the one who first told me you were insane
I promise
Well you know some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them Anyway I was part of the trick sir
He really was tricked horribly
Go after him and try to calm him down a little
He still hasnt told us about the captain
Cesario come here
Taurus
That governs the torso and heart doesnt it
No the legs and thighs
Let me see you dance 
Hes only known you for three days but hes already treating you like a close friend
No not at all
Thanks for telling me
Here comes the Duke now
Has anyone seen Cesario
Be loud and obnoxious
I dont think so my lord
My boy its true
Anyone who says youre a man must not notice how young you are
I know youre the right person for this job
Ill do my best to make this lady love you
Give me too much of it so Ill get sick of it and stop loving
Oh it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets taking their scent with it
It doesnt sound as sweet as it did before
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it
Do you want to go hunting my lord
Hunting what Curio
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up
So let her execute me
How do you know
Well hell be dead so he wont see anything
Thats a lame answer
Where good Miss Mary
From soldiers
Well we all have our special gifts
But still shes going to kill you for being gone so long
Youve made up your mind then
Well go along now
Youd be the funniest person in Illyria… if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking
Shut up you troublemaker no more of that
Here comes my lady
Get that fool out of here
Didnt you hear her guys
Get the lady out of here
Oh go away youre a boring fool
I dont want to have anything to do with you anymore
Besides youve gotten unreliable
If he cannot let the tailor mend him
Anything thats mended is only patched up
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin
If this logic works thats great
If not what can you do about it
I told them to take  Oh what a big mistake
Please let me prove youre a fool
Can you do that
Easily madam
Ill have to ask you some questions madam
Please answer my good little student
Im listening to you only because Ive got nothing better to do
My dear madam why are you in mourning
My dear fool because my brother died
I think his souls in hell my lady
I know his souls in heaven fool
Then youre a fool for being sad that your brothers soul is in heaven
Take away this fool gentlemen
What do you think of this fool Malvolio
Isnt he getting funnier
Yes and hell keep getting funnier till he dies
Old age always makes people act funnyeven wise people but fools more than anybody
I hope you go senile soon sir so you can become a more foolish fool
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that Im not smart but he wouldnt bet two cents that youre not a fool
What do you say to that Malvolio
Im surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker
The other day I saw him defeated in a
I swear anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jesters apprentice
Malvolio your vanity is damaging your good taste
You speak so highly of fools
Madam theres a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you
Was he sent by Count Orsino
I dont know madam
Hes a goodlooking young man and there are a lot of people with him
Whos talking to him now
Sir Toby madam your relative
He talks nothing but nonsense
If hes got a message from the count tell him Im sick or not home
Whos that at the gate uncle
A gentleman
A gentleman
What gentleman
Theres some gentleman out there Good Sir Toby
Nonsense
I defy braindeath
I told you someones at the gate
Yes but who is he
Let him be the devil if he wants to I dont care
God will protect me
Tell me what a drunk is like fool
Hes a fool a madman and a drowned man
The first drink makes him a fool the second makes him crazy and the third drowns him
Go take care of him
Madam that young man out there says hes got to speak to you
I told him you were sick
He claimed he knew that and thats why hes come to speak with you
I told him you were asleep
He claimed to know that already too and said thats the reason hes come to speak with you
What can I say to him lady
Hes got an answer for everything
Tell him hes not going to speak with me
Just a man like any other
But whats he like
He insists hell speak with you whether you want him to or not
How old is he
Not old enough to be a man but not young enough to be a boy
Hes somewhere between boy and man
Hes very handsome and speaks well but hes very young
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding
Show him in
Call in my maid
Maria our lady wants you
Give me my veil
Come put it over my face 
Which one of you is the lady of the house
You can speak to me
I represent her
What do you want
What stunning exquisite and unmatchable beautybut please tell me if youre the lady of the house because Ive never seen her
Id hate to waste my speech on the wrong person because Its very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it
Beautiful ladies please dont treat me badly
Im very sensitive and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings
Where do you come from sir
Im sorry but I memorized what Im supposed to say here today and that question isnt part of the speech I learned
Please my lady just confirm that youre the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech
Are you an actor
No madam
But I swear Im not the person Im playing
Are you the lady of the house
I am unless I somehow stole this role
If youre the lady of the house then its true youre stealing your role because whats yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself
But thats not part of what Im supposed to say
Ill go on with my speech praising you and then Ill get to the point
Get to the point now
Ill let you get away with skipping the praise
Thats too bad because I spent a long time memorizing it and its poetic
That means its more likely to be fake
Please keep it to yourself
If youre just insane then get out of here
Ready to set sail sir
The doors right here
Tell me what you want
Tell me what its about
Its about you
Im not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash
Im coming in peace
But you began so rudely
Who are you
What do you want
Whats going on
What have you heard from her
Take me to the garden
Who I am and what I want are a secret
Everyone please leave us alone for a moment
Most sweet lady Oh sweet
Wheres the passage of holy scripture that youre basing your sermon on
In Orsinos heart
In his heart
In what chapter and verse of his heart
The table of contents says its in the first chapter of his heart
Oh Ive read that
Thats not holy its heresy
Do you have anything else to say
Madam please let me see your face
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face
Youre overstepping your bounds now
But Ill open the curtain and let you see the picture
Look sir this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment
Its pretty well done isnt it
Wind and rain cant wash it off
Oh Id never be that cruel
Ill write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part
But youd still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil
My lord loves you
How does he love me
Your lord knows what I think
I cant love him
I know hes noble rich young and with a fine reputation
People say hes generous well educated and brave and hes very attractive
But I just cant love him
What would you do about it
From that cabin Id call out to my soul
Id write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night
Not bad you might accomplish something
But Im still fairly highranking
Im a gentleman
Go back to your lord
I cant love him
Tell him not to send any more messengersunless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news
Goodbye
Thanks for your trouble
Heres some money for you
Im not a paid messenger my lady
Keep your money
Its my master whos not getting the reward he deserves not me
Goodbye you beautiful cruel woman
But Im still fairly highranking
Ah no
Calm down calm down
If only his lord were more like him
How strange Im feeling
Can someone fall in love this quickly
Come here
At your service madam
Run after that obnoxious messenger the dukes servant
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not
Madam I will
I dont know what Im doing
Fate do your work
We human beings dont control our own destinies
What is fated to happen must happen
No Id rather you stayed here
At least tell me where youre going
Honestly I cant
Im just wandering with no particular destination
But I know youd never force me to tell you things I dont want to so I should be polite and tell you what I can
He left behind myself and my twin sister who was born in the same hour as me
If God had been willing I wish we had died in the same hour too
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves my sister drowned
How tragic
Although many people said she looked like me she was considered beautiful
Shes been drowned in salty sea water and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again
Oh Antonio Im sorry I caused you so much trouble
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you
I like you very much
Im going to Count Orsinos court
Goodbye
I wish you all the best
If I didnt have so many enemies in Orsinos court Id go join you there
But who cares
Excuse me werent you with Countess Olivia just now
Yes sir
Ive only made it this far since I left her place walking at a moderate pace
Shes sending this ring back to you sir
You shouldve saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself
Here take the ring
She took that ring from me
I wont take it back
You threw it at her rudely and she wants you to take it back
I didnt give her any ring
Whats she trying to say
I hope she doesnt have a crush on me
Its true she looked at me a lot in fact she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted and couldnt really finish her sentences very well
Oh I really think she loves me
creet
Im the man she wants
If thats true which it is she might as well be in love with a dream the poor lady
Ah how will this all turn out
What can possibly fix this situation
Oh only time can sort out this mess
I cant figure it out by myself
Come on Sir Andrew
And the doctors say its healthy to get up early I dont know what the doctors say
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late
A false conclusion
I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup
Youre a smart guy
So we should eat and drink
Maria
Bring us some wine
Look here comes the fool
Hello my friends
What a pretty picture three fools all together
Hello you idiot
Sing us a song
What country is this friends
This is Illyria lady
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria
My brother is in heaven
Or maybe theres a chance he didnt drownWhat do you think sailors
It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved
Oh my poor brother
But maybe by some fluke he was saved too
Its possible maam
Dont give up yet
I was born and raised less than three hours from here
I swear this fool has an excellent singing voice
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands and great warriors arent  Ha ha
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life
A love song a love song
Yes yes
Im not interested in being good    
That was excellent really excellent
Good very good
A beautiful voice I swear
His breath stinks
Yes it stinks very sweetly
Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl
Should we do that
Lets go for it
Absolutely
Lets dance to You Jerk You mean Shut up you jerk
So Ill be forced to call you a jerk Sir Andrew
It starts Shut up Ill never be able to start if I shut up
Thats true
But come on start
Youre making a terrible racket out here
Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house
For Gods sake shut up
Are you all crazy
Whats wrong with you
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners or because youre just stupid
Dont you have any respect for anything
We respected the beat of the song sir
So shut up
Sir Toby Ive got to be frank with you
My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because youre a relative she doesnt approve of your behavior
If you can shape up youre welcome to stay in the house
If you cant and would prefer to leave shes very willing to say goodbye to you
No good Sir Toby
Thats out of tune sir
You lie
They certainly will
Youre right
Go and wiggle your ears
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up
Do that
Ill write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf
Or Ill deliver your insults to his face
Dear Sir Toby dont do anything rash tonight
Ever since the Dukes messenger visited Olivia shes been upset
As for Monsieur Malvolio let me take care of him
I know I can do it
Oh Ill beat him up for that
I dont have any brilliant reason for it but I have a good enough reason
Thats the weakness Ill use to get revenge on him
What are you going to do
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivias she
Excellent
I like it too
Hell think these letters are from Olivia and that shes in love with him
Yes thats the idea
Hes going to look like a total idiot
Absolutely you idiot
This is going to be great
Its going to be fun I promise
I know my medicine will work on him
Ill have you two hideand the fool tooright where hell find the letter
Watch his reaction
Meanwhile lets go to bed and dream about this
Good night
Good night you amazing woman you
Shes a fine woman all right
Shes a good little woman and she adores me
What about it
Someone adored me once too
Lets go to bed knight
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you
I know I will too if its the last thing I do
Its too late to go to bed now
Play me some music
Sir the person who should sing that song isnt here
Who was it
Hes somewhere else in the house
Youre absolutely right
Id bet my life that as young as you are youve fallen in love with someone
Havent you boy
A little bit
What kind of woman is she
Shes a lot like you
Shes not good enough for you then
How old is she
About as old as you are my lord
Thats definitely too old
A woman should always pick an older man
I think youre right sir
So find someone younger to love or you wont be able to maintain your feelings
Women are like roses the moment their beauty is in full bloom its about to decay
Thats true
Its too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection
Whos the ruler here
A duke who is noble in name and character
Whats his name
Orsino
Orsino
Ive heard my father mention him
When I first heard about him he was still a bachelor
But there was a rumoryou know people always gossip about royaltythat he was in love with the beautiful Olivia
Whos she
I wish I could work for that lady
Are you ready sir
No trouble sir
I like singing
Then Ill pay you for doing what you like
You may leave
Goodbye
All the rest of you can leave too
Cesario go visit that cruel Olivia one more time
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world and has nothing to do with her property
But if she cant love you sir
I refuse to accept that
But you have to
Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia
Shouldnt she just accept that
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel
No womans heart is big enough to hold all my love
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea
Its as allconsuming and insatiable as the sea and it can swallow as much as the sea can
Dont compare a womans love for a man with my love for Olivia
Yes but I know What do you know
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men
Actually their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you if I were a woman
And whats her story
There was no story my lord
Doesnt that sound like true love
But did your sister die of love
I am the only daughter in my fathers family and all the brothers toobut Im not completely sure about that
Anyway sir should I go see the lady
Come along with us Signor Fabian
Im coming dont worry
If I miss this let me be boiled alive
Wont you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated
Ill be thrilled
You know he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bearbaiting here
Well have another bearbaiting just to make him angry and well mock him till hes black and blue
Wont we Sir Andrew
If we dont itll be the biggest disappointment of our lives
Here comes the little villain herself
How are you my golden girl
Hide behind the boxwood hedge all three of you
Malvolios coming down the path
Hes been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour
This letters going to turn him into a starryeyed idiot
